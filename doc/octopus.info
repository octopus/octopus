   `octopus' is based on a fixed-nucleus code written by George F.
Bertsch and K. Yabana to perform real-time dynamics in clusters (Phys
Rev B *54*, 4484 (1996)) and on a condensed matter real-space
plane-wave based code written by A. Rubio, X. Blase and S.G. Louie
(Phys. Rev. Lett. *77*, 247 (1996)).  The code was afterwards extended
to handle periodic systems by G.F. Bertsch, J.I. Iwata, A. Rubio, and
K. Yabana (Phys. Rev. B, *62*, 7998 (2000)). Contemporaneously there was
a major rewrite of the original cluster code to handle a vast majority
of finite systems. At this point the cluster code was named "tddft".

   This version was consequently enhanced and beautified by A. Castro
(at the time Ph.D. student of A. Rubio), originating a fairly verbose
15,000 lines of Fortran 90/77. In the year 2000, M. Marques (aka
Hyllios, aka Anto'nio de Faria, corsa'rio portugue^s), joined the A.
Rubio group in Valladolid as a postdoc. Having to use "tddft" for his
work, and being petulant enough to think he could structure the code
better than his predecessors, he started a major rewrite of the code
together with A. Castro, finishing version 0.2 of "tddft." But things
were still not perfect: due to their limited experience in Fortran 90,
and due to the inadequacy of this language for anything beyond a HELLO
WORLD program, several parts of the code were still clumsy. Also the
idea of GPLing the almost 20,000 lines arose during an alcoholic
evening. So after several weeks of fantic coding and after getting rid
of the Numerical Recipes code that still lingered around, `octopus' was
born.

   The present released version has been completely rewritten and keeps
very little relation to the old version (even input and output files)
and has been enhanced with major new flags to perform various
excited-state dynamics in finite and extended systems (one-dimensional
periodic chains). The code will be updated frequently and new versions
can be found here (http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus).

   The main features of the present version are described in detail in
_octopus: a first principles tool for excited states electron-ion
dynamics_, Comp. Phys. Comm. *151*, 60 (2003).  Updated references as
well as results obtained with octopus will be posted regularly to the
`octopus' web page. If you find the code useful for you research we
would appreciate if you give reference to this work and previous ones.

   If you have some free time, and if you feel like taking a joy ride
with Fortran 90, just drop us an email <octopus@tddft.org>. You can
also send us patches, comments, ideas, wishes, etc. They will be
included in new releases of octopus.

3.1 Description of `octopus'
============================

`octopus' (1) is a program aimed at the ab initio virtual
experimentation on electron/ion dynamics in external electromagnetic
fields of arbitrary intensity, shape and frequency in a hopefully ever
increasing range of systems types. Its main characteristics are:

   * Electrons are described quantum-mechanically within the
     Density-Functional Theory (DFT) for the ground-state whereas the
     excitation spectra is computed using time-dependent form (TDDFT)
     by performing simulations in time.

   * The electron-nucleus interaction is described within the
     pseudo-potential approximation. Nuclei are described classically
     as point particles.

   * Wave-functions are expanded in a real-space grid. The kinetic
     energy operator is computed with a high-order finite difference
     method.  FFTs are used in part of the calculations.  Time and grid
     spacing are related by imposing a stable time-evolution.

   * Forces on the ions are computed through the Ehrenfest theorem.
     Extension to quantum mechanical nuclear dynamics is in progress.

   * Allows for spin-polarised calculations as well as non-collinear
     magnetism and spin-orbit effects.

   * Computes photo-electron (energy and angle resolved) and
     photo-absorption spectra for different polarised external
     electromagnetic fields. Linear response calculations are a simple
     case of this general time-evolution procedure (see below).

   * Includes non-linear electronic effects: high-harmonic generation,
     interaction with a laser pulse of arbitrary intensity. For the
     time being only time- and spatially-dependent electric fields are
     included, in the future magnetic fields will be incorporated.

   * Reads different geometry files including protein-data-base (PDB)
     for biological calculations (interaction of biomolecules with
     electromagnetic fields).

   * It allows for one and two dimesional modes by using for example
     the soft-coulomb potential or any other given as input.

   * Laser-pulse optimisation using genetic algorithms (to be done).

   * Utilities to analyse the computed spectra.

   * A very effective and easy-to-use parser to handle the input file.

3.2 Time dependent density functional theory
============================================

Several reviews of time-dependent density function theory (TDDFT) and
its applications have appeared recently, like the works by Gross et al.
(1), Casida (2), Dobson et al, (3) , and Burke et al (4).

   The Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham theory as described is a ground state
theory, and it is hence not meant for the calculation of electronic
excitations.  However, one can extend the ideas of static DFT. When one
asks for the evolution of the system under the influence of a
time-dependent external potential, one should search the extrema of the
quantum mechanical action

   A = \int_t0^t1 dt  <\psi(t) | i\partial_t -H(t) | \psi>

   Theorems have now been established for time-dependent DFT(5) which
are parallel to those of static DFT.  The first theorem proves a
one-to-one mapping between time-dependent potentials and time-dependent
densities; the second proves the stationary-action principle.

   The proof of the first theorem is based directly on the evolution of
the time-dependent Schro"dinger equation from a fixed initial
many-particle state \Psi(t_0)=\Psi_0 under the influence of a
time-dependent potential v(t) required to be expandable in a Taylor
series around t_0.  The initial state \Psi_0 does not need to be the
ground state or some other eigenstate of the initial potential.  As one
does not rely on the adiabatic connection as in standard
zero-temperature many-body perturbation theory the formalism is able to
handle external perturbations varying fast in time. By virtue of the
first theorem, the time-dependent density determines the external
potential uniquely up to an additive purely time-dependent function.
On the other hand, the potential determines the time-dependent
wave-function, therefore the expectation value of any quantum
mechanical operator is a unique functional of the density.

   The second theorem deals with the variational principle of the action
functional with the initial condition \Psi(t_0)=\Psi_0.  From the
previous one-to-one mapping between time-dependent potentials and
densities, the action is a functional of the density that must have a
stationary point at the correct time-dependent density.  Thus the Euler
equation corresponding to the extrema of A[\rho],

   \delta A[\rho] / \delta \rho(r) = 0,

   determines the time-dependent density, just as in the Hohenberg-Kohn
formalism the static ground state density is given by the minimum of
the total energy (\delta E[\rho]/\delta \rho(\bf r,t)=0).

   Similarly, one can define a time-dependent Kohn-Sham (KS) scheme by
introducing a non-interacting system that reproduces the exact
interacting density \rho(\bf r,t).  One gets the following
time-dependent KS-equations:

   ( 1/2 \nabla^2 + V_eff(r,t) ) \psi_i(r,t)  = i \partial_t \psi_i(r,t)

   \rho(r,t) = V_H(r,t) = \sum_i=1^N |\psi_i(r,t)|^2

   where

   V_eff(r,t) = V_H(r,t) + V_xc(r,t) + V_ext(r,t)

   is the effective time-dependent potential felt by the electrons. It
consists of the sum of the external time-dependent applied field, the
time-dependent Hartree term, plus the  xc potential (defined through
the equivalence between the interacting and fictitious non-interacting
systems). The variational principle yields

   V_xc(r,t) = \delta A_xc[\rho] / \delta \rho(r,t).

   where A_\rm xc[\rho] is the xc part of the action functional.

   The main advantage of the time-dependent KS scheme lies in its
computational simplicity compared to other quantum-chemical models such
as time-dependent Hartree-Fock or configuration interaction.

4.1 Quick instructions
======================

For the inpatients, here goes the quick-start:
     prompt> gzip -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     prompt> cd octopus-<version>
     prompt> ./configure
     prompt> make
     prompt> make install

   This will probably *not* work, so before giving up, just read the
following paragraphs.

   Also, rpm and deb binaries for linux are supplied on the web-page.


File: octopus.info,  Node: Long instructions,  Next: Troubleshooting,  Prev: Quick instructions,  Up: Installation

4.2 Long instructions
=====================

The code is written in standard Fortran 90, with some routines written
in C (and in bison, if we count the input parser). To build it you will
need both a C compiler (`gcc' works just fine), and a Fortran 90
compiler. No free-software Fortran 90 compiler is available yet, so, if
you want to chew the `octopus', you will have either to help the g95
(http://g95.sourceforge.net) project or use any of the available
comercial compilers.

   Besides the compiler, you will also need:
  1. `make':  most computers have it installed, otherwise just grab and
     install the GNU `make'.

  2. `cpp': The C preprocessor is heavily used in `octopus'.  GNU `cpp'
     is just fine, but any `cpp' that accepts the `-C' flag (preserve
     comments) should work just as well.

  3. FFTW: We have relied on this great library to perform the Fast
     Fourier Transforms (FFTs). You may grab it from here
     (http://www.fftw.org/).  You may use FFTW version 2 as well as
     FFTW version 3. `octopus' will try first to use the latter one,
     since it is significantly faster in some architectures.

  4. LAPACK/BLAS: Required. Our politics is to rely on these two
     libraries as much as possible on these libraries for the linear
     algebra operations.  If you are running Linux, there is a fair
     chance they are already installed in your system. The same goes to
     the more heavyweight machines (alphas, IBMs, SGIs, etc.).
     Otherwise, just grab the source from here (http://www.netlib.org).

  5. GSL: Finally that someone had the nice idea of making a public
     scientific library! GSL still needs to grow, but it is already
     quite useful and impressive.  `octopus' uses splines, complex
     numbers, special functions, etc. from GSL, so it is a must! If you
     don't have it already installed in your system, you can obtain GSL
     from here (http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/). You will need version
     1.0 or higher.

  6. MPI: If you want to run `octopus' in multi-tentacle (parallel)
     mode, you will need an implementation of MPI.  MPICH
     (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/) works just fine in our
     Linux boxes.


   First you should obtain the code file, `octopus<-version>.tar.gz',
(this you probably have already done). The code is freely available, and
can be downloaded from `http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus'. There
exists a `cvs' server, which you can browse at
`http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/marques/octopus/'.  The
sources of the cvs version (in general more unstable the the _official_
distribution) may be downloaded by anonymous cvs access:

     prompt> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@nautilus.fis.uc.pt:/server/cvsroot
             login

     prompt> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@nautilus.fis.uc.pt:/server/cvsroot
             co marques/octopus

   Uncompress and untar it (`gzip -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz | tar
-xvf -').  In the following, `OCTOPUS-HOME' denotes the home directory
of octopus, created by the `tar' command.

   The `OCTOPUS-HOME' contains the following subdirectories:
   * `autom4te.cache, build, CVS, debian': contains files related to
     the building system or the CVS repository. May actually not be
     there.  Not of real interest for the plain user.

   * `doc': The documentation of `octopus' in _texinfo_ format.

   * `liboct': Small C library that handles the interface to GSL and
     the parsing of the input file. It also contains some assorted
     routines that we didn't want to write in boring Fortran.

   * `samples': Sample input files for `octopus'.

   * `share': Made to contain "auxiliary" files eventually used by the
     code; in practice now it contains the Troullier-Martins and
     Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter pseudopotential files.

   * `share/util': Currently, the _utilities_ include a couple of IBM
     OpenDX networks (*note wf.net::), to visualize wavefunctions,
     densities, etc.

   * `src': Fortran 90 source files. Note that these have to be
     preprocessed before being fed to the Fortran compiler, so do not
     be scared by all the # directives.

   Before configuring you can (should) setup a couple of options.
Although the configure script tries to guess your system settings for
you, we recommend that you set explicitly the default Fortran compiler
and the compiler options.  For example, in `bash' you would typically
do:
     export FC=abf90
     export FCFLAGS="-O -YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_"
   if you are using the Absoft Fortran 90 compiler on a linux machine.
Also, if you have some of the required libraries in some unusual
directories, these directories may be placed in the variable `LDFLAGS'
(e.g., `export LDFLAGS=$LDFLAGS:/opt/lib/').

   The configuration script will try to find out which compiler you are
using.  Unfortunately, and due to the nature of the primitive language
that `octopus' is programmed in, the automatic test fails very often.
Often it is better to set the variable `FCFLAGS' by hand. These are
some of the options reported to work:
`intel ifc (PIV)'
     `-u -zero -fpp1 -nbs -i_dynamic -pc80 -pad -align  -unroll -O3 -r8
     -ip -tpp7 -xW'

`absoft (i386)'
     `-O3 -YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_'

`absoft (opteron)'
     `-O3 -mcmodel=medium -m64 -cpu:host -YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_'

`NAG (opteron)'
     `-colour -kind=byte -mismatch_all -abi=64 -ieee=full -O4
     -Ounroll=4'

`pgi (opteron)'
     `-fast -mcmodel=medium -O4'

`alpha'
     `-align dcommons -fast -tune host -arch host -noautomatic'

`xlf (IBM)'
     `-bmaxdata:0x80000000 -qmaxmem=-1 -qsuffix=f=f90 -Q -O5 -qstrict
     -qtune=auto -qarch=auto -qhot -qipa'

`sgi'
     `-O3 -INLINE -n32 -LANG:recursive=on'

   You can now run the configure script (`./configure').  (1) You can
use a fair amount of options to spice `octopus' to your own taste.  To
obtain a full list just type `./configure --help'. Some commonly used
options include:
   * `--prefix=PREFIX': Change the base installation dir of `octopus'
     to `PREFIX'. The executable will be installed in `PREFIX/bin', the
     libraries in `PREFIX/lib' and the documentation in `PREFIX/info'.
     `PREFIX' defaults to the home directory of the user who runs
     `configure'.

   * `--with-fft=fftw2': Instruct the `configure' script to use the FFTW
     library, and specifically to use the FFTW version 2. You may also
     set `--with-fft=fftw3' or even `--disable-fft'.

   * `--with-lapack=<lib>': LAPACK library

   * `--with-gsl-prefix=DIR': Installation directory of the GSL
     library. The libraries are expected to be in `DIR/lib' and the
     include files in `DIR/include'. The value of `DIR' is usually
     found by issuing the command `gsl-config --prefix'. (If the GSL
     library is installed, the program `gsl-config' should be
     somewhere.)

   * `--with-netcdf=<lib>': NETCDF library. This is a recommended
     library.

   * `--enable-mpi': Builds the parallel version (MPI) of `octopus'.

   * `--enable-complex': Builds a version with complex wave-functions
     for the ground-state calculations (wave-functions are always
     complex for the evolution). This is needed when spinors are needed
     -- e.g. noncollinear magnetism is going to be considered, or the
     spin-orbit coupling term will be used.

   * `--enable-debug': Builds a version that is able to emit some
     debugging information. Useful for developers, or to report bugs.
     If `octopus' has been built with this option enabled, you may set
     the variable `Verbose' to "debug" level, and set `DebugLevel'
     (*note Verbose:: and *note DebugLevel::, respectively).

   Run `make', and then `make install'. If everything went fine, you
should now be able to taste `octopus'. Depending on the options passed
to the configure script, some suffixes or prefixes could be added to
the generic name `octopus' -- i.e. `zoctopus' for the code compiled for
complex wave-functions, `zoctopus-mpi' for a parallel version of the
code compiled for complex wave-function, and so on.

   The program has been tested in the following platforms:
   * `i686*-linux-gnu': with the Absoft (http://www.absoft.com),   and
     the Intel (http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/)
     compiler.

   * `alphae*': both in Linux and in OSF/1 with Compaq's `fort'
     compiler.

   * `powerpc-ibm-aix4.3.3.0': with native `xlf90' compiler.

   Build the documentation in the format you prefer. Since you are
reading this, you already have it in some format (but maybe not the
correct version).  Due to the power of `texinfo', a series of formats
are available, namely `dvi', `html', `pdf' and `info'. The
`octopus.texi' source code of this document is in the
`OCTOPUS-HOME/doc' directory.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you downloaded the cvs version, you will not find the
`configure' script.  In order to compile the development version you
will first have to run the GNU autotools.  This may be done by
executing the script `./autogen.sh'.  Note that you need to have
working versions of the `automake' (1.8.5), `autoconf' (2.59) and
`libtool' (1.5.6) programs (the versions we currently use are between
parentheses). Note that the `autogen.sh' script will likely fail if you
have (much) older versions of the autotools.

4.3 Troubleshooting
===================

If you are reading this it is because something went wrong. Let us see
if we can fix it ;)

   *Could not find library...*: This is probably the most common error
you can get. `octopus' uses three different libraries, `GSL', `FFTW',
and `BLAS'/`LAPACK'. We assume that you have already installed these
libraries but, for some reason, you were not able to compile the code.
So, what went wrong?
   * Did you pass the correct `--with-XXXX' (where XXXX is gsl, fftw or
     lapack in lowercase) to the configure script? If your libraries are
     installed in a non-standard directory (like `/opt/lapack'), you
     will have to pass the script the location of the library (in this
     example, you could try `./configure --with-lapack='-L/opt/lapack
     -llapack''.

   * If you are working on an alpha station, do not forget that the
     `CXML' library includes `BLAS' and `LAPACK', so it can be used by
     `octopus'. If needed, just set the correct path with
     `--with-lapack'.

   * If the configuration script can not find `FFTW', it is probable
     that you did not compile `FFTW' with the same Fortran compiler or
     with the same compiler options. The basic problem is that Fortran
     sometimes converts the function names to uppercase, at other times
     to lowercase, and it can add an "_" to them, or even two.
     Obviously all libraries and the program have to use the same
     convention, so the best is to compile everything with the same
     Fortran compiler/options. If you are a power user, you can check
     the convention used by your compiler using the command `nm
     <library>'.


   *Whatever went wrong...*: Up to now, we cannot really make a list of
commonly found problems. So if something else went wrong, please
subscribe to `octopus-users' mailing list, and ask.

5 The parser
************

All input options should be in a file called "`inp'", in the directory
`octopus' is run from. Alternatively, if this file is not found,
standard input is read. For a fairly comprehensive example, just look
at the file `OCTOPUS_HOME/samples/inp'

   At the beginning of the program `liboct' reads the `inp' file,
parses it, and generates a list of variables that will be read by
`octopus' (note that the input is case independent).  There are two
kind of variables, scalar values (strings or numbers), and blocks (that
you may view as matrices). A scalar variable `var' can be defined by:
     var = exp
   `var' can contain any alphanumeric character plus "_", and `exp' can
be a quote delimited string, a number (integer, real, or complex), a
variable name, or a mathematical expression.  In the expressions all
arithmetic operators are supported ("a+b", "a-b", "a*b", "a/b"; for
exponentiation the C syntax "a^b" is used), and the following functions
can be used:
   * `sqrt(x)': The square root of `x'.

   * `exp(x)': The exponential of `x'.

   * `log(x)' or `ln(x)': The natural logarithm of `x'.

   * `log10(x)': Base 10 logarithm of `x'.

   * `sin(x)', `cos(x)', `tan(x)', `cot(x)',   `sec(x)', `csc(x)': The
     sinus, co-sinus, tangent, co-tangent,   secant and co-secant of
     `x'.

   * `asin(x)', `acos(x)', `atan(x)', `acot(x)',   `asec(x)',
     `acsc(x)': The inverse (arc-) sinus, co-sinus, tangent, co-tangent,
      secant and co-secant of `x'.

   * `sinh(x)', `cosh(x)', `tanh(x)', `coth(x)',   `sech(x)',
     `csch(x)': The hyperbolic sinus, co-sinus, tangent, co-tangent,
     secant and co-secant of `x'.

   * `asinh(x)', `acosh(x)', `atanh(x)', `acoth(x)',   `asech(x)',
     `acsch(x)': The inverse hyperbolic sinus, co-sinus, tangent,
     co-tangent,   secant and co-secant of `x'.
   You can also use any of the predefined variables:
   * `pi': 3.141592653589793, what else is there to say?

   * `e': The base of the natural logarithms.

   * `false' or `f' or `no': False in all its flavors. For the
     curious, `false' is defined as 0.

   * `true' or `t' or `yes': The truthful companion of `false'. For the
      curious, `true' is defined as 1.

   Blocks are defined as a collection of values, organised in row and
column format.  The syntax is the following:
     %var
       exp | exp | exp | ...
       exp | exp | exp | ...
       ...
     %
   Rows in a block are separated by a newline, while columns are
separated by the character "|" or by a tab. There may be any number of
lines and any number of columns in a block. Note also that each line
can have a different number of columns.

   If `octopus' tries to read a variable that is not defined in the
`inp' file, it automatically assigns to it a default value. All
variables read are output to the file "`out.oct'". If you are not sure
of what the program is reading, just take a look at it.  Everything
following the character "#" until the end of the line is considered a
comment and is simply cast into oblivion.

6.1.4 `Units' (string, 'a.u')
-----------------------------

Atomic units seem to be the preferred system in the atomic and
molecular physics community (despite the opinion of some of the authors
of this program). Internally, the code works in atommic units. However,
for input or output, some people like using eV for energies and AA for
lengths. This other system of units (the _convenient system_, in words
of Prof. George F. Bertsch), can also be used. See the Frequently Asked
Questions for some more details.  Valid options are:
   - `'a.u'': atomic units

   - `'eVA'': electron-volts/aangstro"m


File: octopus.info,  Node: UnitsInput,  Next: UnitsOutput,  Prev: Units,  Up: Generalities

6.1.5 `UnitsInput' (string, 'a.u.'):
------------------------------------

Same as `Units', but only refers to the values in the input file.  That
is, if `UnitsInput = "eVA"', all physical values in the input files
will be considered to be in eV and AA.

6.1.7 `Verbose' (integer, 30)
-----------------------------

Verbosity level of the program. The higher, the more verbose `octopus'
is. Current levels are:
   - `Verbose <=  0': Silent mode. No output except fatal errors.

   - `Verbose >   0': Warnings only.

   - `Verbose >  20': Normal program info.

   - `Verbose > 999': Debug mode. Issues a message to standard error
     every time the  program enters an (important) subroutine, and
     prints the time it spend upon return.

6.2 Species Block
=================

* Menu:

* Species::


File: octopus.info,  Node: Species,  Prev: Species Block,  Up: Species Block

6.2.1 `Species' (block data)
----------------------------

A specie is by definition an ion (nucleus + core electrons) described
through a pseudo-potential, or a model potential.  The format of this
block is different for 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, and can be best understood
through examples.

   * In 1D, or 2D, e.g.
            %Species
              'H'  | 1.0079 | 1 | "-1/sqrt(x^2 + 1)"
            %
     This defines a species labelled '`H'' of weight `1.0079', and
     valence charge `1'. This "valence charge" is used to calculate the
     number of electrons present in the calculation: as many as
     indicated by the valence charges of the species, plus any extra
     charge specified by the user (*note States::). Last field may be
     any user defined potetial - use `x', `r' (and `y' in the 2D case)
     for the position of the electron relative to the species center.
     For example. the potential often used in 1D calculations is the
     soft-Coulomb potential -Z/sqrt(x*x + 1).

   * In 3D, e.g.
            %Species
              'O'       | 15.9994 | 8   | "tm2"  | 1 | 1
              'H'       |  1.0079 | 1   | "hgh"  | 0 | 0
              'jelli01' | 23.2    | 8.0 |  5.0
              'point01' | 32.3    | 2.0
              'usdef'   | 1 | 8 | "1/2*r^2"
            %
     In this case, we have 5 "species" present:
        - Oxygen labelled '`O''. Next number is the atomic mass (in
          atomic mass units), and third field, the atomic number (8, in
          this case).  Afterwards, "tm2" is the flavour of the
          pseudopotential: "tm2" stands for Troullier-Martins. This
          means the pseudopotential will be read from an `O.ascii' or
          `O.vps' file, either in the working directory or in the
          `OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/TM2' directory.  Next two numbers are
          the maximum _l_-component of the pseudo-potential to consider
          in the calculation, and the _l_-component to consider as
          local.

        - Hydrogen defined in the same way as Oxygen. In this case,
          however, the flavour is "hgh" standing for
          Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter. Last two numbers are irrelevant.

        - All species whose label starts by 'jelli' are jellium spheres.
          The other parameters are the weight, the nuclear charge, and
          the valence charge of the sphere.

        - All species whose label starts by 'point' are point charges.
          The other parameters are the weight and the nuclear charge. In
          fact, point charges are implemented as _rather small_ jellium
          spheres, with zero valence charge.

        - All species whose label starts by 'usdef' are user defined
          potentials. The second parameter is the mass, whereas the
          third parameter is the 'valence charge', used to calculate
          the number of electrons.  Finally, the potential itself is
          defined by the fourth argument.  Use any of the `x', `y', `z'
          or `r' variables to define the potential.

     Note that some common pseudopotentials are distributed with the
     code in the directory `OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/'. To use this
     pseudopotentials you are not required to define them explicitly in
     the `Species' block, as defaults are provided by the program (you
     can override these defaults in any case).  Additional
     pseudopotentials can be downloaded from the `octopus' homepage
     (http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/pseudo.php).

6.3 Coordinates Description
===========================

`octopus' successively tries to read the atomic coordinates from a PDB
file, a XYZ file, or else directly from the `inp' file.

* Menu:

* PDBCoordinates::
* XYZCoordinates::
* Coordinates::
* XYZVelocities::
* Velocities::
* RandomVelocityTemp::


File: octopus.info,  Node: PDBCoordinates,  Next: XYZCoordinates,  Prev: Coordinates Description,  Up: Coordinates Description

6.3.1 `PDBCoordinates' (string, 'coords.pdb')
---------------------------------------------

Tries to read the atomic coordinates from the file `PDBCoordinates'.
The PDB (Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/)) format is quite
complicated, and it goes well beyond the scope of this manual. You can
find a comprehensive description in
`http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html'.
From the plethora of instructions defined in the PDB standard, `octopus'
only reads 2, `ATOM' and `HETATOM'. From these fields, it reads:
   - columns 13-16 : The specie; in fact `octopus' only cares about the
     first letter - 'CA' and 'CB' will both refer to Carbon - so
     elements whose chemical symbol has more than one letter can not be
     represented in this way.  So, if you want to run mercury ('Hg')
     please use one of the other two methods to input the atomic
     coordinates, `XYZCoordinates' or `Coordinates'.

   - columns 18-21 : The residue. If residue is 'QM', the atom is
     treated in Quantum Mechanics, otherwise it is simply treated as an
     external classical point charge. Its charge will be given by
     columns 61-65.

   - columns 31-54 : The Cartesian coordinates. The Fortran format is
     `'(3f8.3)''.

   - columns 61-65 : Classical charge of the atom. The Fortran format is
     `'(f6.2)''.


File: octopus.info,  Node: XYZCoordinates,  Next: Coordinates,  Prev: PDBCoordinates,  Up: Coordinates Description

6.3.2 `XYZCoordinates' (string, 'coords.xyz')
---------------------------------------------

If `PDBCoordinates' is not present, reads the atomic coordinates from
the XYZ file `XYZCoordinates'. The XYZ format is very simple, as can be
seem from this example for the CO molecule (in AA).
     2
     CO molecule in equilibrium
         C  -0.56415   0.0   0.0
         O   0.56415   0.0   0.0
   The first line of the file has an integer indicating the number of
atoms. The second can contain comments that are simply ignored by
`octopus'. Then there follows one line per each atom, containing the
chemical species and the Cartesian coordinates of the atom.


File: octopus.info,  Node: Coordinates,  Next: XYZVelocities,  Prev: XYZCoordinates,  Up: Coordinates Description

6.3.3 `Coordinates' (block data)
--------------------------------

If neither a `XYZCoordinates' nor a `PDBCoordinates' was found,
`octopus' tries to read the coordinates for the atoms from the block
`Coordinates'. The format is quite straightforward:
         %Coordinates
           'C' | -0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
           'O' |  0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
         %
   The first line defines a Carbon atom at coordinates (`-0.56415',
`0.0', `0.0'), that is _not_ allowed to move during dynamical
simulations. The second line has a similar meaning. This block
obviously defines a Carbon monoxide molecule, if the input units are
AA. Note that in this way it is possible to fix some of the atoms (this
is not possible when specifying the coordinates through a
`PDBCoordinates' or `XYZCoordinates' file). It is always possible to
fix _all_ atoms using the `MoveIons' directive.


File: octopus.info,  Node: XYZVelocities,  Next: Velocities,  Prev: Coordinates,  Up: Coordinates Description

6.3.4 `XYZVelocities' (string, 'velocities.xyz')

`octopus' will try to read the starting velocities of the atoms from
the XYZ file `XYZVelocities'.


File: octopus.info,  Node: Velocities,  Next: RandomVelocityTemp,  Prev: XYZVelocities,  Up: Coordinates Description

6.3.5 `Velocities' (block data)
-------------------------------

If `XYZVelocities' is not present, `octopus' will try to fetch the
initial atomic velocities from this block. If this block is not
present, `octopus' will reset the initial velocities to zero. The
format of this block can be illustrated by this example:
         %Velocities
           'C'  | -1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
           'O'  |  1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
         %
   It describes one Carbon and one Oxygen moving at the relative
velocity of `3.4', velocity units.  Note: It is important for the
velocities to maintain the ordering in which the species were defined
in the coordinates specifications.

the atoms following a Bolzmann distribution with temperature
`RandomVelocityTemp'.

`octopus' uses a grid in real space to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
The grid is equally-spaced, but the spacings can be different for each
Cartesian direction. The shape of the simulation region may also be
tuned to suit the geometric configuration of the system.

It is the shape of the simulation box. The allowed values are:
   - `sphere': A sphere

   - `cylinder': A cylinder. The cylinder axis will be in the z
     direction

   - `minimum': Sum of spheres around each atom.

   - `parallelepiped': As the name indicates.
   For a 1D calculation, it would obviously always be a 1D "sphere".

Defines in which space gradients and the Laplacian are calculated.
Allowed values are:
   - `real_space': Derivatives are calculated in real-space       using
     finite differences. The order of the derivative can be set with
       `OrderDerivatives'.

   - `fourier_space': Derivatives are calculated in       reciprocal

If `octopus' was compiled for periodic systems, the number of _k_

6.5.5 `Occupations' (block data)
--------------------------------

The occupation numbers of the orbitals can be fixed through the use of
this variable. For example:
         %Occupations
           2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0
         %
   would fix the occupations of the five states to `2.0'. There must be
as many columns as states in the calculation. If `SpinComponents == 2'
this block should contain two lines, one for each spin channel.  This
variable is very useful when dealing with highly symmetric small systems
(like an open shell atom), for it allows us to fix the occupation
numbers of degenerate states in order to help `octopus' to converge.
This is to be used in conjuction with `ExtraStates'. For example, to
calculate the carbon atom, one would do:
       ExtraStates=2
       %Occupations
           2 | 2/3 | 2/3 | 2/3

-----------------------------------------------

The guess density for the SCF cycle is just the sum of all the atomic
densities.  When performing spin-polarized or non-collinear spin
calculations this option sets the guess magnetization density.
Possible values are:
   - `paramagnetic':  Magnetization density is zero.

   - `ferromagnetic': Magnetization density is the sum of the atomic
     magnetization densities.

   - `random': Each atomic magnetization density is randomly rotated.

   - `user_defined': The atomic magnetization densities are rotated so
     that the magnetization                                vector has
     the same direction as a vector provided by the user.
   When the `user_defined' option is used the `AtomsMagnetDirection'
block has to be set.

   For anti-ferromagnetic configurations the `user_defined' option
should be used.

   Note that if the `paramagnetic' option is used the final
ground-state will also be paramagnetic, but the same is not true for
the other options.

to maintain the ordering in which the species were defined in the

   Look up the source to know what the differences are.

   In both cases, for the first iterations of the cycle there is no
need to perform a very precise diagonalisation. Because of this, we may
define a varying tolerance, so that at the first iteration a given small
tolerance is achieved, and then this tolerance is linearly increased
until a given iteration, after which a maximum tolerance is always
asked.  Next variables take care of this process.

6.10 Time Dependent
===================

When `CalculationMode = (td | td_start)', the code performs the time
propagation of the electronic orbitals and - if required - of the ionic
positions. This latter task does not pose major algorithmical problems
(the usual Verlet algorithms deal with that task); however the best way
to propagate a Schro"dinger-like equation is still unclear. Due to this
fact, we provide with a rather excessive selection of possibilities for
that purpose. Before describing the set of variables necessary to
specify the way in which the time evolution is to be performed, it is
worth making a brief introduction to the problem.

   We are concerned with a set of Schro"dinger-like equations for the
electronic orbitals:

   i{\partial psi_i \over \partial t} = H(t)\psi_i(t)\,,

   \psi_i(t=0) = \psi_i^0\,.

   Being the equation linear, one may formally define a linear
"evolution" operator, which trasforms the initial vector into the
solution at time T:

   \psi_i(T) = U(T, 0)\psi_i^0

   Moreover, there is a formal exact expression for the evolution
operator:

   \psi_i(T) = T\exp\lbrace -i\!\!\int_0^{T}d\tau H(\tau)\rbrace
\psi_i^0\,.

   where T\exp is the time-ordered exponential. If the Hamiltonian
conmutes with itself at different times, we can drop the time-ordering
product, and leave a simple exponential.  If the Hamiltonian is
time-independent - which makes it trivially self commuting, the
solution is then simply written as:

   \psi_i(T) = \exp\lbrace -iTH\rbrace \psi_i^0\,.

   Unfortunately, this is not the case in general. We have to find an
algorithm able to cope with time-dependent Hamiltonians, such as the
self-consistent time-dependent Kohn-Sham operator, which is built "self
consistently" from the varying electronic density.

   The first step is to perform a time-discretization: the full
propagation between 0 and T is decomposed as:

   U(T,0) = \prod_{i=0}^{N-1}U(t_i+\delta t,t_i)\,,

   where t_0=0, t_N=T, \delta t = T/N. So at each time step we are
dealing with the problem of performing the short-time propagation:

   \psi_i(t+\delta t) = U(t+\delta t, t)\psi_i(t) = T\exp\lbrace
-i\!\!\int_{t}^{t+\delta t}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!d\tau\,H(\tau)\rbrace
\psi(t)\,.

   In this way, one can monitor the evolution in the interior of [0,t].
In fact, the possibility of monitoring the evolution is generally a
requirement; this requirement imposes a natural restriction on the
maximum size of \delta t: if \omega_\rm max is the maximum frequency
that we want to discern, \delta t should be no larger than \approx
1/\omega_\rm max.  Below this \delta t_\rm max, we are free to choose
\delta t considering performance reasons: Technically, the reason for
the discretization is twofold: the time-dependence of H is alleviated,
and the norm of the exponential argument is reduced (the norm increases
linearly with \delta t).

   Since we cannot drop the time-ordering product, the desired algorithm
cannot be reduced, in principle, to the calculation of the action of
the exponential of an operator over the initial vector.  Some
algorithms tailored to approximate the evolution operator, in fact, do
not even require to peform such operator exponentials.  Most of them,
however, do rely on the calculation of one or more exponentials, such
as the ones used by `octopus'. This is why in principle we need to
specify two different issues: the "evolution method", and the
"exponential method". In other words: we need an algorithm to
approximate the evolution operator U(t+\delta t, t) - which will be
specified by variable `TDEvolutionMethod' (*note TDEvolutionMethod::) -
and, if this algorithm requires it, we will also need an algorithm to
approximate the exponential of a matrix operator \exp\lbrace A\rbrace -
which will be specified by variable `TDExponentialMethod' (*note
TDExponentialMethod::).

6.10.3 `TDExponentialMethod' (integer, standard)
------------------------------------------------

Method used to numerically calculate the exponential of the Hamiltonian,
a core part of the full algorithm used to approximate the evolution
operator, specified through the variable `TDEvolutionMethod' (*note
TDEvolutionMethod::).  In the case of using the Magnus method,
described below, the action of the exponential of the Magnus operator
is also calculated through the algorithm specified by this variable.

   - `split': Split-operator (SO).

     It is important to distinguish between applying the split operator
     method to calculate the exponential of the Hamiltonian at a given
     time - which is what this variable is referring to - from the
     split operator method as an algorithm to approximate the full
     evolution operator U(t+\delta t, t), and which will be described
     below as one of the possibilities of the variable
     `TDEvolutionMethod'.  The equation that describes the split
     operator scheme is well known:

     \exp_{\rm SO} (-i \delta t H) = \exp (-i \delta t/2 V) \exp (-i
     \delta t T) \exp (-i \delta t/2 V)\,.

     Note that this is a "kinetic referenced SO", since the kinetic
     term is sandwiched in the middle. This is so because in `octopus',
     the states spend most of its time in real-space; doing it
     "potential referenced" would imply 4 FFTs instead of 2.  This
     split-operator technique may be used in combination with, for
     example, the exponential midpoint rule as a means to approximate
     the evolution operator.  In that case, the potential operator `V'
     that appears in the equation would be calculated at time t+\delta
     t/2, that is, in the middle of the time-step.  However, note that
     if the split-operator method is invoked as a means to approximate
     the evolution operator (`TDEvolutionMethod = 0'), a different
     procedure is taken - it will be described below -, and in fact the
     variable `TDExponentialMethod' has no effect at all.

   - `suzuki-trotter': Suzuki-Trotter (ST).

     This is a higher-order SO based algorithm. See O. Sugino and Y.
     Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. B *59*, 2579 (1999). Allows for larger
     time-steps, but requires five times more time than the normal SO.

     The considerations made above for the SO algorithm about the
     distinction between using the method as a means to approximate
     `U(t+\delta t)' or as a means to approximate the exponential also
     apply here. Setting `TDEvolutionMethod = 1' enforces the use of
     the ST as an algorithm to approximate the full evolution operator,
     which is slightly different (see below).

   - `lanczos': Lanczos approximation (LAN).

     Allows for larger time-steps.  However, the larger the time-step,
     the longer the computational time per time-step.  In certain
     cases, if the time-step is too large, the code will emit a warning
     whenever it considers that the evolution may not be properly
     proceeding - the Lanczos process did not converge. The method
     consists in a Krylov subspace approximation of the action of the
     exponential (see M. Hochbruck and C. Lubich, SIAM J. Numer. Anal.
     *34*, 1911 (1997) for details).  Two more variables control the
     performance of the method: the maximum dimension of this subspace
     (controlled by variable `TDExpOrder'), and the stopping criterium
     (controlled by variable `TDLanczosTol').  The smaller the stopping
     criterium, the more precisely the exponential is calculated, but
     also the larger the dimension of the Arnoldi subspace. If the
     maximum dimension allowed by `TDExpOrder' is not enough to meet
     the criterium, the above-mentioned warning is emitted.

   - `standard': N-th order standard expansion of the exponential (STD).

     This method amounts to a straightforward application of the
     definition of the exponential of an operator, in terms of it
     Taylor expansion.

     \exp_{\rm STD} (-i\delta t H) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} {(-i\delta
     t)^i\over{i!}} H^i.

     The order k is determined by variable `TDExpOder' (*note
     TDExpOrder::).  Some numerical considerations (by Jeff
     Giansiracusa and George F. Bertsch; see
     `http://www.phys.washington.edu/~bertsch/num3.ps') suggest the 4th
     order as especially suitable and stable.

   - `chebyshev': N-th order Chebyshev expansion (CHEB).

     In principle, the Chebyshev expansion of the exponential
     represents it more accurately than the canonical or standard
     expansion.  As in the latter case, `TDExpOrder' determines the
     order of the expansion.

     There exists a closed analytical form for the coefficients of the
     exponential in terms of Chebyshev polynomials:

     \exp_{\rm CHEB} \left( -i\delta t H \right) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}
     (2-\delta_{k0})(-i)^{k} J_k(\delta t) T_k(H),

     where J_k are the Bessel functions of the first kind, and H has te
     be previously scaled to [-1,1].  See H. Tal-Ezer and R. Kosloff,
     J. Chem. Phys. *81*, 3967 (1984); R. Kosloff, Annu. Rev. Phys.

6.10.6 `TDEvolutionMethod' (integer, etrs)
------------------------------------------

This variable determines which algorithm will be used to approximate
the evolution operator U(t+\delta t, t). That is, known \psi(\tau) and
H(\tau) for tau \le t, calculate t+\delta t. Note that in general the
Hamiltonian is not known at times in the interior of the interval
[t,t+\delta t].  This is due to the self-consistent nature of the
time-dependent Kohn-Sham problem: the Hamiltonian at a given time \tau
is built from the "solution" wavefunctions at that time.

   Some methods, however, do require the knowledge of the Hamiltonian
at some point of the interval [t,t+\delta t]. This problem is solved by
making use of extrapolation: given a number l of time steps previous to
time t, this information is used to build the Hamiltonian at arbitrary
times within [t,t+\delta t]. To be fully precise, one should then
proceed _self-consistently_: the obtained Hamiltonian at time t+\delta t
may then be used to interpolate the Hamiltonian, and repeat the
evolution algorithm with this new information. Whenever iterating the
procedure does not change the solution wave-functions, the cycle is
stopped. In practice, in `octopus' we perform a second-order
extrapolation without self-consistente check, except for the first two
iterations, where obviously the extrapolation is not reliable.

   * `split': Split Operator (SO).

     This is one of the most traditional methods. It splits the full
     Hamiltonian into a kinetic and a potential part, performing the
     first in Fourier-space, and the latter in real space. The
     necessary transformations are performed with the FFT algorithm.

     U_{\rm SO}(t+\delta t, t) = \exp \lbrace - {i \over 2}\delta t T
     \rbrace              \exp \lbrace -i\delta t V^* \rbrace
       \exp \lbrace - {i \over 2}\delta t T \rbrace

     Since those three exponentials may be calculated exactly, one does
     not need to use any of the methods specified by variable
     `TDExponentialMethod' to perform them.

     The key point is the specification of V^*. Let V(t) be divided into
     V_\rm int(t), the "internal" potential which depends
     self-consistently on the density, and V_\rm ext(t), the external
     potential that we know at all times since it is imposed to the
     system by us (e.g. a laser field): V(t)=V_\rm int(t)+V_\rm ext(t).
     Then we define to be V^* to be the sum of V_\rm ext(t+\delta t/2)
     and the internal potential built from the wavefunctions _after_
     applying the right-most kinetic term of the equation, \exp \lbrace
     -i\delta t/2 T \rbrace.

     It may the be demonstrated that the order of the error of the
     algorithm is the same that the one that we would have by making
     use of the Exponential Midpoint Rule (EM, described below), the SO
     algorithm to calculate the action of the exponential of the
     Hamiltonian, and a full self-consistent procedure.

   * `suzuki-trotter' Suzuki-Trotter (ST).

     This is the generalization of the Suzuki-Trotter algorithm,
     described as one of the choices of the `TDExponentialMethod'
     (*note TDExponentialMethod::), to time-dependent problem. Consult
     the paper by O. Sugino and M. Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. B *59*, 2579
     (1999), for details.

     It requires of Hamiltonian extrapolations.

   * `etrs': Enforced Time-Reversal Symmetry (ETRS).

     The idea is to make use of the time-reversal symmetry from the
     beginning:

     \exp \left(-i\delta t/2 H_{n}\right)\psi_n = exp \left(i\delta t/2
     H_{n+1}\right) \psi_{n+1},

     and then invert to obtain:

     \psi_{n+1} = \exp \left(-i\delta t/2 H_{n+1}\right) exp
     \left(-i\delta t/2 H_{n}\right) \psi_{n}.

     But we need to know H_n+1, which can only be known exactly through
     the solution \psi_n+1. What we do is to estimate it by performing
     a single exponential: \psi^*_n+1=\exp \left( -i\delta t H_n
     \right) \psi_n, and then H_n+1 = H[\psi^*_n+1]. Thus no
     extrapolation is performed in this case.

   * `aetrs': Approximated Enforced Time-Reversal Symmetry (AETRS).

     A modification of previous method to make it faster.  It is based
     on extrapolation of the time-dependent potentials. It is faster by
     about 40%.

     The only difference is the procedure to estimate H_n+1: in this
     case it is extrapolated trough a second-order polynomial by making
     use of the Hamiltonian at time t-2\delta t, t-\delta t and t.

   * `exp_mid': Exponential Midpoint Rule (EM).

     This is maybe the simplest method, but is is very well grounded
     theretically: it is unitary (if the exponential is performed
     correctly) and preserves time symmetry (if the self-consistency
     problem is dealt with correctly).  It is defined as:

     U_{\rm EM}(t+\delta t, t) = \exp \left( -i\delta t H_{t+\delta
     t/2}\right)\,.

   * `magnus': Magnus Expansion (M4).  This is the most sophisticated
     approach. It is a fourth order scheme (feature that shares with
     the ST scheme; the other schemes are in principle second order).
     It is tailored for making use of very large time steps, or
     equivalently, dealing with problem with very high-frequency time
     dependence.  It is still in a experimental state; we are not yet
     sure of when it is advantageous.


   This proliferation of methods is certainly excessive; The reason for
it is that the propagation algorithm is currently a topic of active
development. We hope that in the future the optimal schemes are clearly
identified. In the mean time, if you don't feel like testing, use the
default choices and make sure the time step is small enough.

6.10.7 `TDLasers' (block data)
------------------------------

Each line of the block describes a laser pulse applied to the system.
The syntax is:
         %TDLasers
           polx | poly | polz | A0 | omega0 | envelope | tau0 | t0
         %
   where `pol' is the (complex) polarisation of the laser field, `A0'
the amplitude, `envelope' the envelope function, `t0' the middle
(maximum) of the pulse and `omega0' the frequency of the pulse. The
meaning of `tau0' depends on the envelope function.  The possible
values for `envelope' are:

   - `1': Gaussian envelope. `tau0' is the standard deviation of the
     pulse.

   - `2': Cosinoidal envelope. `tau0' is half the total length of the
     pulse.

   - `3': Ramp. In this case there is an extra parameter `tau1'. `tau0'
     is the length of the constant part of the ramp, and `tau1' is the
     raising (decaying) time. `tau1' should be an extra field after
     `t0'.

   - `10': Shape is read from a file.

   If `envelope=10', the `t0' parameter is substituted by a string that
determines the name of the file. The format of this file should be three
columns of real numbers: time, field and phase. Atomic units are
assumed. The values for the laser field that the program will use are
interpolated / extrapolated from this numerically defined function.

Every given number of time iterations, or after ground-state
calculations, some of the functions that characterise the system may be
written to disk so that they may be analized. Files are written within
"static" output directory after the self-consistent field, or within
"td.x" directories, during evolution, where "x" stands for the
iteration number at which each write is done.  Note that if you wish to
plot any function (`OutputKSPotential = yes', etc.), at least one of
the output formats should be enabled (`OutputPlaneX = yes', `OutputDX =
yes', `OutputNETCDF = yes', etc.). [This is not necessary if you wish
to plot the geometry (`OutputGeometry = yes')]. Note further that the
data written by `OutputAxisX', `OutputPlaneX' etc. has always the

geometry. Data points which are inexistent in the actual geometry have
the value zero in those files.

7.1 `oct-sf'
============

This utility generates the dipole strength function of the given system.
Its main input is the `td.general/multipoles' file. Output is written
to a file called `spectrum'. This file is made of two columns: energy
(in eV or a.u., depending on the units specified in `inp'), and dipole
strength function (in 1/eV, or 1/a.u., idem).

   In the `inp' file, the user may set the `SpecTransformMode' - this
should be set to "sin" for proper use -, the `SpecDampMode' -
recommended value is "pol", which ensures fulfilling of the N-sum rule,
the `SpecStartTime', the `SpecEndTime', the `SpecEnergyStep', the
`SpecMinEnergy' and the `SpecMaxEnergy'.

7.6 `oct-excite'
================

Calculates the excitation spectrum within linear response. This utility
can output just the difference of eigenvalues by setting
`LinEigenvalues', the excitations using M. Petersilka formula
(`LinPetersilka'), or M. Casida (`LinCasida'). This utility requires
that a calculation of unoccupied states (`CalculationMode' = unocc) has
been done before, and it outputs the results to the sub-directory
"linear". The states entering the calculation can be chosen with the
variable `ExciteStates' (*note OutputWfsNumber::)

7.7 `oct-broad'
===============

Generates a spectrum by broadening the excitations obtained by the
`oct-excite' utility. The parameters of the spectrum can be set using
the variables `LinBroadening', `LinMinEnergy', `LinMaxEnergy', and
`LinEnergyStep'.

7.8 `oct-make-st'
=================

`make_st' reads `tmp/restart.static' and replaces some of the Kohn-Sham
states by Gaussians wave packets. The states which should be replaced
are given in the `%MakeStates' section in the `inp' file and written to
`tmp/restart.static.new'. (You probably want to copy that file to
`tmp/restart.static' and use then `CalculationMode=5' or `6'.)

     %MakeStates
       ik | ist | idim | type | sigma | x0 | k
     %

   The first values stand for

   * ik: The k point (or the spin, if `spin-components=2') of the state

   * ist: The state to be replaced

   * idim: The component of the state (if the wave functions have more
     than one component, i.e. when `spin-components=3' is used).

   * The type of the wave packet; currently only `1' (Gaussian) is
     available

   The next items depend on the type chosen.  For a Gaussian wave
packet, defined as

   psi(x) = 1/sigma sqrt(1/2pi) exp(ik(x-x0)) exp(-(x-x0)^2/(2
sigma^2)),

   they are:

   * \sigma the width of the Gaussian

   * k: the *k* vector. In 3D use `k1|k2|k3'.

   * x_0: the coordinate where the Gaussian is initially centred. In 3D
     use `x01|x02|x03'.

7.9 `oct-center-geom'
=====================

This utility centers and aligns the coordinates of the molecule. It
reads the file specified in the input file (either by the `Coordinates'
block, or by the `XYZCoordinates' or `PDBCoordinates' variables), and
outputs the adjusted coordinates to the file `adjusted.xyz'. The
following parameters are read from the `inp'ut file:

   * `MainAxis' (block data): A vector of three reals defining the axis
     to which the molecule should be align. If not present, the default
     value will be
              %MainAxis
                1 | 0 | 1
              %

   * `AxisType' (int, inertia): This variable describes how to
     calculate the "main" axis of the molecule. Possible values are:
        - `inertia' or `1': Axis of inertia;

        - `pseudo'  or `2': Axis of inertia calculated as if all atoms
          had mass 1;

        - `large'   or `2': The longest axis of the molecule.

7.10 `wf.net'
=============

This is an OpenDX network, aimed at the visualization of wave-functions.
To be able to use it, you need to have properly installed the OpenDX
program (get it at opendx.org), as well as the Chemistry extensions
obtainable at the Cornell Theory Center
(http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Services/Vis/dx/index.asp).  Once these are
working, you may follow a small tutorial on `wf.net' by following next
steps:

   o Place in a directory the program wf.net, the (needed) auxiliary
     file wf.cfg, and the sample inp file that can all be found in
     `OCTOPUS-HOME'/util.

   o Run `octopus'. The inp file used prescribes the calculation of the
     C atom in its ground state, in spin-polarized mode. It also
     prescribes that the wave-functions should be written in "dx"
     format. At the end, these should be written in subdirectory
     "static": wf-00x-00y-1.dx, where x runs from 1 to 2 (spin quantum
     number) and y runs from 1 to 4 (wave-function index).

   o Run the OpenDX program. Click on "Run Visual Programs" on the DX
     main menu, and select the program `wf.net'. The program will be
     executed, and several windows should open. One of them should be
     called "Application Comment". It contains a small tutorial. Follow
     it from now on.

9.0.1 Hello world
-----------------

As a first example, we will take a sodium atom.  With your favourite
text editor, create the following input "inp".
       SystemName = 'Na'
       CalculationMode = 1
       %Species
         'Na' | 22.989768 | 11 | "tm2" | 0 | 0
       %
       %Coordinates
         'Na' | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
       %
       Radius = 12.0
       Spacing = .6
       TypeOfMixing = 2

   This input file should be essentially self-explanatory.  Note that a
Troullier-Martins pseudopotential file ("Na.vps", or "Na.ascii") should
be accesible to the program. A sample "Na.ascii" may be found in
`OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/TM2'. If `octopus' was installed (`make install'
was issued after `make'), there should be no need to do anything - the
program should find it. Otherwise, you may as well place it in the
working directory.  Then run `octopus' - for example, do `octopus > out
', so that the output is stored in "out" file. If everything goes OK,
"out" should look like (1):

   Take now a look at the working directory. It should include the
following files:
     -rw-rw-r--    1 user  group       177 Jul 10 12:29 inp
     -rw-rw-r--    1 user  group      4186 Jul 10 12:35 out
     -rw-rw-r--    1 user  group      1626 Jul 10 12:35 out.oct
     drwxrwxr-x    2 user  group      4096 Jul 10 12:35 static
     drwxrwxr-x    2 user  group      4096 Jul 10 12:35 tmp

   Besides the initial file (`inp') and the `out' file, two new
directories appear. In `static', you will find the file `info', with
information about the static calculation (it should be hopefully
self-explanatory, otherwise please complain to the authors).  In `tmp',
you will find the `restart.static', a binary file containg restart
information about the ground-state, which is used if, for example, you
want to start a time-dependent calculation afterwards.  Finally, you
can safely ignore `out.oct': it is an output from the liboct library,
irrelevant for what concerns physics ;).

   *Exercises*:
   * Study how the total energy and eigenvalue of the sodium atom
     improve   with the mesh spacing.

   * Calculate the static polarizability of the sodium atom
     (`CalculationMode = 7').    Two new files will be generated:
     `restart.pol' that can be used to resume   the polarizability
     calculation, and `Na.pol' that contains the static polarizability
     tensor. Note that this calculation overwrites
     `tmp/restart.static', so that   what now is there is the ground
     state for the system _with_ an external static   electrical field
     applied. Delete it since it is useless.

   * Calculate a few unoccupied states (`CalculationMode = 3'). The
     eigenspectrum   will be in the file `eigenvalues'. Why don't we
     find a Rydberg series in the   eigenspectrum?

   * Repeat the previous calculation with PBE, LB94, and exact exchange.
      Don't forget to *move* the file `tmp/restart.static' when
     switching   between exchange-correlation functionals.

   * Perform a time-dependent evolution (`CalculationMode = 5'), to
     calculate   the optical spectrum of the Na atom. Use a
     `TDDeltaStrength = 0.05', polarised   in the `x' direction. The
     multipole moments of the density are output to   the file
     `td.general/multipoles'. You can process this file with the utility
      `strength-function' to obtain the optical spectrum.    If you
     have computer time to waste, re-run the time-dependent
     simulation for some other xc choices.

9.0.2 Benzene
-------------

Well, the sodium atom is a bit too trivial. Let's try something harder:
benzene.  you will just need the geometry for benzene to be able to
play. Here it is (in AA):
      C  0.000  1.396  0.000
      C  1.209  0.698  0.000
      C  1.209 -0.698  0.000
      C  0.000 -1.396  0.000
      C -1.209 -0.698  0.000
      C -1.209  0.698  0.000
      H  0.000  2.479  0.000
      H  2.147  1.240  0.000
      H  2.147 -1.240  0.000
      H  0.000 -2.479  0.000
      H -2.147 -1.240  0.000
      H -2.147  1.240  0.000

   Follow now the steps of the previous example. Carbon and Hydrogen
have a much harder pseudo-potential than Sodium, so you will probably
have to use a tighter mesh. It also takes much more time...
