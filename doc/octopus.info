   The main developing team of this program is composed by of Miguel A.
L. Marques and Angel Rubio, working at the Donostia International
Physics Center and Department of Materials Science UPV/EHU (San
Sebastian, Espan~a), and Alberto Castro, who works at the University of
Valladolid, Departamento de Fisica Teorica (Valladolid, Espan~a).

   `Octopus' is based on a nuclear-physics code written by George F.
Bertsch, K. Yabana to perform real-time dynamics in clusters (Phys Rev
B *54*, 4484 (1996)) and on a condensed matter real-space plane-wave
based code written by A. Rubio, X. Blase and S.G. Louie (Phys. Rev.
Lett. *77*, 247 (1996)).  The code was atfterwards extended to handled
periodic systems by G.F. Bertsch, J.I. Iwata, A. Rubio, and K. Yabana
(Phys. Rev. B, *62*, 7998 (2000)). Contemporanely there was a major
rewrite of the original cluster code to handle a vast majority of
finite systems. At this point the cluster code was named tddft.x.

   This version was consequently enhaced and beautified by A. Castro
(at the time Ph.D. student of A. Rubio), originating a fairly imponent
15,000 lines of FORTRAN 90/77. In the year 2000, M. Marques (aka
Hyllios, aka António de Faria, corsário português), joins the A. Rubio
group in Valladolid as a postdoc. Having to use TDDFT for his work, and
being petulant enough to think he could structure the code better than
his predecessors, starts a major rewrite of the code together with A.
Castro, finishing version 0.2 of TDDFT. But things were still not
perfect: due to their limited experience in FORTRAN 90, and due to the
inadequacity of this language for anything beyond a HELLO WORLD
program, several parts of the code were still clumsy. Also the idea of
GPLing the almost 20,000 lines arose during an alcoholic evening. So
after several weeks of frantic coding and after getting rid of the
Numerical Recipes code that still lingered around, `Octopus' was born.

   The present released version has been completely rewritten and keeps
very little relation to the old version (even input and output files)
and has been enhaced with major new flags to perform various
excited-state dynamics in finite and extended sytems (one-dimensional
periodic chains). The code will be updated frequently and new versions
can be found here (http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus).

   The main features of the present version are described in detail in
the following article M.L. Marques, A. Castro, A. Rubio .....  Computer
Physics Communications  (2002).  Updated references as well as results
obtained with octpus will be posted regularly in the octopus web page.
If you find the code useful for you research we would appreciete if you
give reference to this work and previous ones.

   If you have some free time, and if you feel like taking a joy ride
with FORTRAN 90, just drop us an email <octopus@tddft.org>. You can
also send us patches, comments, ideas, wishes, etc. They will be
included in new releases of octopus.

Description of `octopus'
========================

   `octopus' (1) is a program aimed at the ab initio virtual
experimentation on electron/ion dynamics in external electromagnetid
fields of arbitrary intensity, shape and frequency in a hopefully ever
increasing range of systems types. Its main characteristics are:

   * Electrons are described quantum-mechanically within the
     Density-Functional Theory (DFT) for the ground-state whereas the
     excitation spectra is computed using time-dependent form (TDDFT)
     by performing simulations in time.

   * The electron-nucleus interaction is described within the
     Pseudopotential approximation. Nuclei are described classically
     as point particles.

   * Wavefunctions are expanded in a real-space grid. The kinetic
     energy operator is computed with a high-order finite difference
     method.  FFTs are used in part of the calculations. (Scaling N$^2$
     in the dynamical part). Time and grid spacing are related by
     imposing stable time-evolution.

   * Forces on the ions are computed through the Ehrenfest theorem.
     Extension to quantum mechanical nuclear dynamics is in progress.

   * Allows for spin-polarized calculations as well as non-collinear
     magnetism and spin-orbit effects (Pauli-Dirac equation).

   * Computes photoelectron (energy and angle resolved) and
     photabsorption spectra for different polarized external
     electromagnetic fields. Linear response calculations are a simple
     case of this general time-evolution procedure (see below).

   * Includes non-linear electronic effects: high-harmonic generation,
     interaction with a laser pulse of arbitrary intensity. For the
     time being only time- and spatialy-dependent electric fields are
     included, in the future magnetic fields will be incorporated.

   * Reads different geometry files including protein-data-base (PDB)
     for biological calcalations (interaction of biomolecules with
     electromagnetic fields).

   * It allows the calculation of one-dimensional potentials, using for
     example the soft-coulomb potential or any other given as input.

   * Laser-pulse optimization using genetic algorithms (to be done).

   * Utilities to analyse the computed spectra.

   * A very effective and easy-to-use parser to handle the input file.

Time dependent density functional theory
========================================

   Several reviews of time dependent density function theory (TDDFT)
and its applications have appeared recently, like the works by Gross et
al. (1), Casida (2), Dobson et al, (3) , and Burke et al (4).

   The Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham theory as described is a ground state
theory, and it is hence not meant for the calculation of electronic
excitations.  However, one can extend the idea of static DFT. When one
asks for the evolution of the system under the influence of a
time-dependent external potential, one should search the extrema of the
quantum mechanical action Theorems have now been established for
time-dependent DFT(5) which are parallel to those of static DFT.  The
first theorem proves a one-to-one mapping between time-dependent
potentials and time-dependent densities; the second one proves the
stationary-action principle.

   The proof of the first theorem is based directly on the evolution of
the time-dependent Schro"dinger equation from a fixed initial
many-particle state determines the time dependent density, just as in
the Hohenberg-Kohn formalism the static ground state density is given
by the minimum of the total energy where is the xc part of the action
functional

   The main advantage of the time-dependent KS-scheme lies in its
computational simplicity compared to other quantum-chemical models such
as time-dependent Hartree-Fock or configuration interaction.

Installation
************

   For the impatients, here goes the quickstart:
     tar -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz
     cd octopus-<version>
     ./configure
     make
     make install

   This will probably *not* work, so before giving up, just read the
following paragraphs.

   The code is written in standard Fortran 90, with a couple of routines
in C (and in bison, if we count the input parser). To build it you will
need both a C compiler (`gcc' works just fine), and a Fortran 90
compiler. No free Fortran 90 compiler is available yet, so, if you want
to chew the `octopus', you will have either to help the g95
(http://g95.sourceforge.net) project or pay some money.

   Besides the compilers, you will also need:
  1. `make' :  Version 3.79 or higher of GNU `make'   should work; any
     other _could_ work, but maybe not.

  2. `cpp' : The C preprocessor is heavily used in `octopus'.    GNU
     `cpp' is just fine, but any `cpp' that accepts   the `-C' flag
     (preserve comments) should work just as well.

  3. FFTW : In principle `octopus' can live without FFTW, but he will
     feel somehow weaker. Just grab this great library from
     `http://www.fftw.org/'

  4. LAPACK/BLAS : Not heavily used, but required. If you are running
     Linux, there is a fair chance they are already installed in your
     system. The same goes to the more heavyweight machines (alphas,
     IBMs, SGIs, etc). Otherwise, just grab the source from
     `http://www.netlib.org'.

  5. GSL : Finally that someone had the nice idea of making a public
     scientific   library! GSL still needs to grow, but it is already
     quite useful and impressive.    `octopus' uses splines, complex
     numbers, special functions, etc. from GSL,   so it is a must! If
     you don't have it already installed in your system, you can
     obtain FFTW from `http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/'. You will need
     version 1.0   or higher.

  6. MPI : If you want to run `octopus' in multi-tentacle (parallel)
     mode,   you will need an implementation of MPI.    `mpich'
     (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/) works just fine in our
     Linux boxes.

   First you should obtain the code gzipped-tarred file
`octopus<-version>.tar.gz' (this you probably have already done). The
code is freely available, and can be downloaded from
`http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus'. There exits a `cvs' server,
but it currently does not have anonymous access. You can nevertheless
browse the repository in
`http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/marques/octopus/'.
Uncompress and untar it (`gzip -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz | tar -xvf
-').  In the following, `OCTOPUS-HOME' denotes the home directory of
octopus, created by the `tar' command.

   The `OCTOPUS-HOME' contains the following subdirectories:
   * `doc' : The documentation of `octopus' in _texinfo_ format.

   * `liboct' : Small C library that handles the interface to     GSL
     and the parsing of the input file. It also contains some assorted
       routines that we didn't want to write in boring Fortran.

   * `src' : Fortran 90 source files. Note that these have to be
     preprocessed     before being fed to the Fortran compiler, so do
     not be scared by     all the # directives.

   * `samples' : Sample input files for `octopus'

   Before configuring you can (should) setup a couple of options.
Although the configure script tries to guess your system settings for
you, we recommend that you set explicitly the default Fortran 90
compiler and the compiler options. In `bash' you would tipically do:
     export F90=abf90
     export F90FLAGS="-YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_"
   If you are compiling in an alpha, or in some other system with
proprietary LAPACK/BLAS support, you should also set the `LIB_LAPACK'
variable:
     export LIB_LAPACK="-lcxml"

   You can now run the configure sript (`./configure'). You can use a
fair amount of options to spice (`octopus') to your own taste.  To
obtain a full list just type `./configure --help'. Some commonly used
options include:
   * `--prefix=PREFIX' : Change the base instalation dir of `octopus'
     to `PREFIX'. The executable will be installed in `PREFIX/bin',
     the libraries in `PREFIX/lib' and the documentation in
     `PREFIX/info'.

   * `--with-fftw=DIR' : Instalation directory of the FFTW library.

   * `--with-lapack=DIR' : Instalation directory of the LAPACK and
     BLAS libraries.

   * `--with-gsl=DIR' : Instalation directory of the GSL library. The
     libraries are expected to be in `DIR/lib' and the include   files
     in `DIR/include'

   * `--enable-1d' : Build the 1d version of `octopus'. This option
     turns off `--enable-3d', etc.

   * `--enable-3d' : Build the 3d version of `octopus'. This is the
     default behaviour.

   Run `make', and then `make install'. If everything went fine, you
should now be able to taste `octopus'.

   The program has been tested in the following platforms:
   * `i686*-linux-gnu' : With the Absoft (http://www.absoft.com)
     compiler.

   * `alphae*-linux-gnu' : With Compac's `fort' compiler.
   If you manage to compile/run `octopus' in a different platform or
with a different compiler, please let us know so we can update the
list. Patches to solve compiler issues are also welcomed.

   Build the documentation in the format you prefer. Since you are
reading this, you already have it in some format. Due to the power of
`texinfo', a series of formats are available, namely `dvi', `html',
`pdf' and `info'. You simply have to `cd' to `OCTOPUS-HOME/doc' and
`make <format>'. The `info' file may be read by the `info' program by
typing `info -f octopus.info', or alternatively may be installed in
your general `info' structure by typing `make install'.

The parser
==========

   All input options should be in a file called '`inp'', in the
directory `octopus' is run from. For a fairly comprehensive example,
just look at the file `OCTOPUS_HOME/samples/inp'

   At the begining of the program `liboct' reads the `inp' file, parses
it, and generates a list of variables that will be read by `octopus'
(note that the input is case independent).  There are two kind of
variables, scalar values (strings or numbers), and blocks (that you may
view as matrices). A scalar variable `var' can be defined by:
     var = exp
   `var' can contain any alphanumeric character plus "_", and `exp' can
be a quote delimited string, a number (integer, real, or complex), a
variable name, or a mathematical expression.  In the expressions all
arithmetic operators are supported ("a+b", "a-b", "a*b", "a/b"; for
exponenciation the C syntax "a^b" is used), and the following functions
can be use:
   * `sqrt(x)' : The square root of `x'.

   * `exp(x)' : The exponential of `x'.

   * `log(x)' or `ln(x)': The natural logarith of `x'.

   * `log10(x)' : Base 10 logarith of `x'.

   * `sin(x)', `cos(x)', `tan(x)', `cot(x)',   `sec(x)', `csc(x)': The
     sinus, cosinus, tangent, cotangent,   secant and cosecant of `x'.

   * `asin(x)', `acos(x)', `atan(x)', `acot(x)',   `asec(x)',
     `acsc(x)': The inverse (arc-) sinus, cosinus, tangent, cotangent,
     secant and cosecant of `x'.

   * `sinh(x)', `cosh(x)', `tanh(x)', `coth(x)',   `sech(x)',
     `csch(x)': The hyperbolic sinus, cosinus, tangent, cotangent,
     secant and cosecant of `x'.

   * `asinh(x)', `acosh(x)', `atanh(x)', `acoth(x)',   `asech(x)',
     `acsch(x)': The inverse hyperbolic sinus, cosinus, tangent,
     cotangent,   secant and cosecant of `x'.
   You can also use any of the predefined variables:
   * `pi' : 3.141592653589793, what else is there to say?

   * `e' : The base of the natural logarithms.

   * `false' or `f' or `no' : False in all its flavors. For the
     curious, `false' is defined as 0.

   * `true' or `t' or `yes' : The truthful companian of `false'. For the
      curious, `true' is defined as 1.

   Blocks are defined as a collection of values, organized in row and
column format.  The syntax is the following:
     %var
       exp | exp | exp | ...
       exp | exp | exp | ...
       ...
     %
   Rows in a block are separated by a newline, while columns are
separated by the character "|". There may be any number of lines and any
number of columns in a block. Note also that each line can have a
different number of columns.

   If `octopus' tries to read a variable that is not defined in the
`inp' file, it automatically assigns to it a default value. All
variables read are output to the file '`out.oct''. If you are not sure
of what the program is reading, just take a look at it.  Everything
following the character "#" until the end of the line is simply cast
into oblivion.

Input file options
==================

   `octopus' has quite a few options, that we will subdivide in
different groups.  After the name of the option, its type and default
value (when appliable) are given in parentesis.

Generalities
------------

   *   `Verbose' (integer, 30) :   Verbosity level of the program. The
     higher, the   more verbose `octopus' is. Current levels are:
        - `verbose <=  0' : Silent mode. No output except fatal errors.

        - `verbose >   0' : Warnings only.

        - `verbose >  20' : Normal program info.

        - `verbose > 999' : Debug mode. Issues a message everytime the
              program enters a (important) subroutine, and prints the
          time it spend upon return.

   *   `SystemName' (string, 'system') :   A string that identifies the
     current run. This parameter is used   to build the names of the
     files generated by `octopus'   (`SystemName.restart',
     `SystemName.mult', etc).

   *   `CalculationMode' (integer, 1) :   It defines the type of
     simulation to perform. Options are:
        - `1' : Start static calculation.

        - `2' : Resume static calculation.

        - `3' : Calculate unocuppied states.

        - `4' : Resume calculation of unocuppied states.

        - `5' : Start time-dependent propagation.

        - `6' : Resume time-dependent propagation.

        - `7' : Start static polarizability calculation.

        - `8' : Resume static polarizability calculation.

        - `9' : Perform Born-Oppenheimer MD simulation

        - `99' : Prints out an octopus recipe

   * `Units' (string, 'a.u'):   Atomic units seem to be the preferred
     system in the atomic and   molecular physics community, despite
     the opinion of some of the authors   of this program. Accordingly,
     atomic units can be used both for   input and output. However,
     some people like using eV for energies and AA   for lengths. This
     other system of units (the _convenient system_,   in words of
     Prof. George W. Bertsch), can also be used.    Valid options are:
        - `'a.u'' : atomic units

        - `'eVA'' : electron-volts/amstrongs

     *Note A word about units::, for detailed information about units.
     Two other   input variables are possible: `UnitsInput', and
     `UnitsOutput',   if different units are desired for input and
     output.



File: octopus.info,  Node: Species,  Next: Coordinates,  Prev: Generalities,  Up: Input file options

Species
-------

   * `Species' (block data) :   A specie is by definition an ion
     (nucleus + core electrons) described   through a pseudopotential,
     or an external potential (until now,   only jellium spheres and
     point charges are implemented).    The format of this block is
     different for 1 or 3 dimensions, and   can be best understood
     through examples. In 1D, e.g.
              %Species
                'H'       |  1.0079 | 2.0 |  1.0
              %
       This defines a species labeled '`H'' of weight `1.0079',
     nuclear charge `2.0', and valence charge `1.0'. The potential
     used in 1D calculations is the soft-Coulomb potential Z/sqrt(x*x +
     1).    In 3D, e.g.
              %Species
                'O'       | 15.9994 | 8   |  1   | 1
                'H'       |  1.0079 | 1   |  0   | 0
                'jelli01' | 23.2    | 8.0 |  5.0
                'point01' | 32.3    | 2.0
              %
       In this case, we have 4 "species" present:
        - Oxygen labeled '`O'', to be read from a pseudopotential file
            name `O.vps'. Numbers following the label describe
          succesively the weight, the nuclear charge, the maximum
          _l_-component of the pseudopotential to consider in the
          calculation, and the _l_-component to consider as local.

        - Hydrogen defined in the same way as Oxygen.

        - All species whose label starts by 'jelli' are jellium spheres.
             The other parameters are the weight, the nuclear charge,
          and the     valence charge of the sphere.

        - All species whose label starts by 'point' are point charges.
             The other parameters are the weight and the nuclear
          charge. In     fact, point charges are implemented as _rather
          small_ jellium     spheres, with zero valence charge.

Coordinates
-----------

   * `PDBCoordinates' (string, 'coords.pdb') :   Tries to read the
     atomic coordinates from the file `PDBCoordinates'.    The PDB
     (Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/)) format is   quite
     complicated, and it goes well beyond the scope of this manual. You
      can find a comprehensive description in
     `http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html'.
      From the plethora of instructions defined in the PDB standard,
     `octopus'   only reads 2, `ATOM' and `HETATOM'. From these fields,
     it reads:
        - columns 13-16 : The specie; in fact `octopus' only cares
          about the first     letter - 'CA' and 'CB' will both refer to
          Carbon - so elements whose     chemical symbol has more than
          one letter can not be represented in this way.      So, if
          you want to run mercury ('Hg') please use one of the other
          two methods     to input the atomic coordinates,
          `XYZCoordinates' or `Coordinates'.

        - columns 18-21 : The residue. If residue is 'QM', the atom is
          treated     in Quantum Mechanics, otherwise it is simply
          treated as an external classical     point charge. Its charge
          will be given by columns 61-65.

        - columns 31-54 : The cartesian coordinates. The Fortran format
          is     `'(3f8.3)''.

        - columns 61-65 : Classical charge of the atom. The Fortran
          format is     `'(f6.2)''.

   * `XYZCoordinates' (string, 'coords.xyz') :   If `PDBCoordinates' is
     not present, reads the atomic coordinates   from the XYZ file
     `XYZCoordinates'. The XYZ format is very simple,   as can be seem
     from this example for the CO molecule (in AA).
              2
                CO molecule in equilibrium
              C  -0.56415   0.0   0.0
              O   0.56415   0.0   0.0
       The first line of the file has an integer indicating the number
     of   atoms. The second can contain comments that are simply
     ignored by   `octopus'. Then there follows one line per each atom,
     containing   the chemical species and the cartesian coordinates of
     the atom.

   * `Coordinates' (block data) :   If neither a `XYZCoordinates' or a
     `PDBCoordinates' was found,   `octopus' tries to read the
     coordinates for the atoms from the   block `Coordinates'. The
     format is quite straightforward:
              %Coordinates
                'C' | -0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
                'O' |  0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
              %
       The first line defines a Carbon atom at coordinates (`-0.56415',
      `0.0', `0.0'), that is _not_ allowed to move during   dynamical
     simulations. The second line has a similar meaning. This   block
     obviously defines a Carbon monoxide molecule, if the input   units
     are AA.

   * `AdjustCoordinates' (logical, false) :   If true, translates the
     atom coordinates so that the   geometrical center of the molecule
     coincides with the zero of   the mesh, and rotates them, fixing
     the largest dimension   of the molecule to the axis defined
     through `MainAxis'.    Very useful when handling large and
     elongated molecules - try   it out!

   * `MainAxis' (block data) :   Defines the axis to be used if
     `AdjustCoordinates' is true.    If not set defaults to the z axis.

   * `OutputCoordinates' (logical, false) :   If true `octopus' outputs
     a XYZ file called   '`SystemName'.xyz' containing the coordinates
     of the atoms   treated within Quantum Mechanics. If point charges
     were defined   in the PDB file (see `PDBCoordinates'), they will
     be output   in the file '`SystemName'_classical.xyz'.

Velocities
----------

   * `XYZVelocities' (string, 'velocities.xyz') :   `octopus' will try
     to read the starting velocities of the atoms from the XYZ file
     `XYZVelocities'.

   * `Velocities' (block data) :   If `XYZVelocities' is not present,
     `octopus' will try fetch the initial   atomic velocities from this
     block. If this block is not present, `octopus'   will reset the
     initial velocities to zero. The format of this block can be
     illustrated by this example:
              %Velocities
                'C'  | -1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
                'O'  |  1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
              %
       It describes one Carbon and one Oxygen moving at the relative
     velocity of `3.4', velocity units.

Mesh
----

   `octopus' uses a grid in real space to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
 The grid is equally-spaced, but the spacings can be different for each
 cartesian direction. The shape of the simulation region may also   be
tuned to suit the geometric configuration of the system.

   * `BoxShape' (integer, sphere) :   In a 3D calculation, it is the
     shape of the simulation box. The allowed   values are:
        - `sphere' or `1': A sphere

        - `cilinder' or `2': A cilinder. The cilinder axis will be
          in the z direction

        - `minimum' or `3': Sum of spheres around each atom.

        - `parallelpiped' or `4': As the name indicates.

   * `Radius' (double, 20.0 a.u.) or (block data) :   If `BoxShape !=
     parallelpiped' defines the radius of the   spheres or of the
     cilinder. Otherwise, `Radius' is assumed to   be a block of the
     form:
              %Radius
                sizex | sizey | sizez
              %
       where `size' is half an edge of the box.

   * `ZLength' (double, 1.0 a.u.) :   If `BoxShape == cilinder' is half
     the total length of the cilinder.

   * `Spacing' (double, 0.6 a.u.) or (block data) :   If the code is
     compiled in 1D mode or if `BoxShape != parallelpiped'   defines
     the (constant) spacing between points in the grid. Otherwise, it
     is assumed to be a block of the form:
              %Spacing
                spacingx | spacingy | spacingz
              %

   * `DerivativesSpace' (integer, real_space)   Defines in which space
     gradients and the laplacian are calculated. Allowed values   are:
        - `real_space' or `0' : Derivatives are calculated in real-space
               using finite differences. The order of the derivative
          can be set with       `OrderDerivatives'.

        - `fourier_space' or `1' : Derivatives are calculated in
          reciprocal space. Obviously this case implies cyclic boundary
          conditions,       so be careful.

   * `OrderDerivatives' (integer, 4) :   If `DerivativesSpace ==
     real_space' use a finite difference discretization   for the
     derivatives of order `OrderDerivatives*2 + 1'.



File: octopus.info,  Node: States,  Next: Hamiltonian,  Prev: Mesh,  Up: Input file options

States
------

   * `SpinComponents' (integer, 1) :   Defines the spin mode `octopus'
     will run in. Valid modes are:
        - `1' : Spin-unpolarized calculation.

        - `2' : Spin-polarized calculation (collinear spin). This mode
              will double the number of wavefunctions necessary for a
          spin-unpolarized       calculation.

        - `4': Non-collinear spin. This mode will double the number
           of wavefunctions necessary for a spin-unpolarized
          calculation, and each of       the wavefunctions will be a
          2-spinor.

   * `NumberKPoints' (integer, 1) :   If `octopus' was compiled for
     periodic systems, the number of   _k_ points to use in the
     calculation. If `NumberKPoints == 1',   use only the Gamma point.

   * `ExcessCharge' (double, 1) :   The net charge of the system. A
     negative value means that we are adding   electrons, while a
     positive value means we are taking electrons   from the system.

   * `EmptyStates' (integer, 1) :   How many unoccupied states to use
     in the ground-state   calculation. Note that this number is
     unrelated to `CalculationMode == 4'.

   * `Occupations' (blockdata) :   The occupation numbers of the
     orbitals can be fixed through the use of this   variable. For
     example:
              %Occupations
                2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0
              %
       would fix the occupations of the five states to `2.0'. There
     must be   as many columns as states in the calculation. If
     `SpinComponents == 2'   this block should contain two lines, one
     for each spin channel.    This variable is very useful when
     dealing with highly symmetric small systems   (like an open shell
     atom), for it allows us to fix the occupation numbers   of
     degenerate states in order to help `octopus' to converge.

   * `ElectronicTemperature' (double, 0.0)   If `Occupations' is not
     set, `ElectronicTemperature' is the   temperature in the
     Fermi-Dirac function used to distribute the electrons   among the
     existing states.

   * `NonInteractingElectrons' (logical, false) :   If `true', treat
     the electrons as non-interacting, i.e. neglect both   Hartree and
     exchange-correlation contributions to the Kohn-Sham potential.

   * `ClassicPotential' (logical, false) :   If `truee', add to the
     external potential the potential generated by   the point charges
     read from the PDB input (see `PBDCoordinates').

   * `LocalPotentialSpace' (integer, fourier_space) :   If
     `fourier_space', generate the local part of the pseudopotential
     in Fourier space; Otherwise do it directly in real space.
     _Generating   the potential in Fourier space seems to reduce the
     egg-box effect but this   option has not been extensively tested._

   * `NonLocalPotentialSpace' (integer, real_space) :   If
     `fourier_space' generate the non-local part of the pseudopotential
      in Fourier space; Otherwise do it directly in real space.
     _Generating   the potential in Fourier space seems to reduce the
     egg-box effect but this   option has not been extensively tested._

   * `GridRefinement' (integer, 3) :   If `NonLocalPotentialSpace ==
     fourier_space' defines the number of   points to use in the
     interpolation method for the non-local part of the
     pseudopotential. _This seems to reduce the egg-box effect but this
      option has not been extensively tested._

   The exchange-correlation functional is controled by the 4 parameters

     == 0' is the initial tolerance for the eigenvectors.

   * `EigenSolverFinalTolerance' (double, 1.0e-14) :   When

     to go from `EigenSolverInitTolerance' to
     `EigenSolverFinalTolerance'.

     steps.

   * `TDEvolutionMethod' (integer, 2) :   Method used to perform the
     time propagation. Authorized values are:
        - `1' : Quick and dirty method. One should check carefully
          the time-step, and it only works with density based
          functionals.

        - `2' : Modified Krank-Nicholson method. Very stable method,
            but significatively slower than method `1'.

   * `TDTimeStep' (double, 0.07 a.u.) :   Time step for the propagation.

   * `TDAbsorbingBoundaries' (integer, 0) :   To improve the quality of
     the spectra by avoiding the formation of   standing density waves,
     one can make the boundaries of the simulation   box absorbing. The
     possible values for this parameter are:
        - `0' : No absorbing boundaries.

        - `1' : A sin^2 imaginary potential is added at the boundaries.

        - `2' : A mask is applied to the wavefunctions at the
          boundaries.

   * `TDABWidth' (real, 0.4 a.u.) :   Width of the region used to apply
     the absorbing boundaries.

     output to the file '`Sysname'.mult'   during a time-dependent

     '`Sysname'.proj'.

   * `MoveIons' (integer, 0) :   See `MoveIons' in the Born-Oppenheimer

   * `TDPES_rc_points' (block data) :   List of points where to

   * `BOTimeStep' (double, 0.1 a.u.) :   Time-step used to integrate
     the Born-Oppenheimer equations of motion.    The default value
     `0.1' can safely be increased when performing   steepest descents
     (`MoveIons == 1').

   * `Gamma' (double, 0.4) :   Value for the drag term when performing
     damped   newtonian dynamics (`MoveIons == 2').

   * `PoissonSolver' (integer, 3) :   In 3D defines which method to use
     in order to solve the Poisson equation.    Allowed values are:
        - `1' : Conjugated gradient method.

        - `3' : FFTs with spherical cutoff.

   * `DoubleFFTParameter' (double, 2.0) :   If the Poisson equation is
     solved in Fourier space, `octopus'   uses a box larger than the
     simulation box in order to avoid the spurious   interaction
     between neighbouring boxes when the system is charged.    Ideally,
     this parameter should be `2.0', but it can be safely   decreased
     in order to improve the efficiency of `octopus' for   neutral
     systems and if there is little ionization.

   * `POLStaticField' (double, 0.001 a.u.) :   Magnitude of the static
     field used to calculate the static polarizability   in
     `CalculationMode = 7, 8'.

   * `RecipeLang' (string, 'en') :   In `CalculationMode = 99' defines
     the language in which to print   the recipe. Allowed values are
     (for now) `'en'' and `'es''.

Hello world
-----------

   As a first example, we will take a sodium atom. The pseudopotential
for sodium can be found in `pseudo/vps/i686/Na.vps'.  Start by creating
a working directory, in which you should place the pseudopotential
file. Then, with your favorite text editor, create the following input
file (let's call it `inp' ;)
       SystemName = 'Na_atom'
       CalculationMode = 2
     
       %Species
         'Na' | 22.989768 | 11 | 0 | 0
       %
     
       %Coordinates
         'Na' | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
       %
     
       Radius = 12.0
       Spacing = .7
     
       TypeOfMixing = 2

   This input file should be essencially self-explanatory.  Then run
the `octopus' program. Take now a look at the working directory. It
should include the following files:
     -rw-r--r--    1 user  group           565 Jul 25 22:47 inp
     -rw-r--r--    1 user  group        267288 Jul 25 22:51 Na_atom.restart
     -rw-r--r--    1 user  group          1061 Jul 25 22:51 Na_atom.static
     -rw-r--r--    1 user  group         59281 Jul 25 22:44 Na.vps
     -rw-r--r--    1 user  group          2506 Jul 25 22:51 out.oct

   Besides the two initial files (`inp' and `Na.vps'), three other were
created. `Na_atom.restart' contains essentially the wavefunctions in
binary, and will be used in subsequent runs. `Na_atom.static' contains
a summary of the ground-state properties, the most important of each
are the eigenspectrum of the system, and the total energy.  Finally,
you can safely ignore `out.oct': it is an output from the liboct
library, irrelevant in what concerns physics ;).

   *Exercices* :
   * Study how the total energy and eigenvalue of the sodium atom
     improve   with the mesh spacing.

   * Calculate the static polarizability of the sodium atom
     (`CalculationMode = 7').    Two new files will be generated:
     `Na_atom.pol_restart' that can be used to resume   the
     polarizability calculation, and `Na_atom.pol' that contains the
     static polarizability   tensor. This calculation overwrites
     `Na_atom.restart', so please *delete it*   after finishing the
     polarizability calculation.

   * Calculate a few unoccupied states (`CalculationMode = 3'). The
     eigenspectrum   will be in the file `Na_atom.occ'. Why don't we
     find a Rydberg series in the   eigenspectrum?

   * Repeat the previous calculation with PBE, LB94, and exact echange.
     Comment the results   you obtained. Don't forget to *move* the
     file `Na_atom.restart' when switching   between
     exchange-correlation functionals.

   * Perform a time-dependent evolution (`CalculationMode = 5'), to
     calculate   the optical spectrum of the Na atom. Use a
     `TDDeltaStrength = 0.05', polarized   in the `x' direction. The
     multipole moments of the density are output to   the file
     `Na_atom.mult'. You can process this file with the utility
     `spectrum.x' to obtain the optical spectrum.    If you have
     computer time to waste, re-run the time-dependent simulation for
     some other xc choices.

   Well, the sodium atom is a bit too trivial. Let's try something
harder: benzene.  In principle, you will just need the pseudopotencial
for Carbon and Hydrogen, and the geometry for benzene to be able to
play. Here they are:

        pg      Carbon
             tm2
      n=C  c=ca
            0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0
         1    4
         2    0     2.00      0.00
         2    1     2.00      0.00
         3    2     0.00      0.00
         4    3     0.00      0.00
        1.50     1.50     1.50     1.50

        pg      Hydrogen
             tm2
      n=H  c=ca
            0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0
         0    4
         1    0     1.00      0.00
         2    1     0.00      0.00
         3    2     0.00      0.00
         4    3     0.00      0.00
        1.25     1.25     1.25     1.25

   and the geometry is (in AA)
      C  0.000  1.396  0.000
      C  1.209  0.698  0.000
      C  1.209 -0.698  0.000
      C  0.000 -1.396  0.000
      C -1.209 -0.698  0.000
      C -1.209  0.698  0.000
      H  0.000  2.479  0.000
      H  2.147  1.240  0.000
      H  2.147 -1.240  0.000
      H  0.000 -2.479  0.000
      H -2.147 -1.240  0.000
      H -2.147  1.240  0.000

   Follow now the steps of the previous example. Carbon and Hydrogen
have a much harder pseudopotential than Sodium, so you will probably
have to use a tighter mesh. It also takes much more time...
