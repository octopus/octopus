   `octopus' is based on a fixed-nucleus code written by George F.
Bertsch and K. Yabana to perform real-time dynamics in clusters (Phys
Rev B *54*, 4484 (1996)) and on a condensed matter real-space
plane-wave based code written by A. Rubio, X. Blase and S.G. Louie
(Phys. Rev. Lett. *77*, 247 (1996)).  The code was afterwards extended
to handle periodic systems by G.F. Bertsch, J.I. Iwata, A. Rubio, and
K. Yabana (Phys. Rev. B, *62*, 7998 (2000)). Contemporaneously there was
a major rewrite of the original cluster code to handle a vast majority
of finite systems. At this point the cluster code was named "tddft".

   This version was consequently enhanced and beautified by A. Castro
(at the time Ph.D. student of A. Rubio), originating a fairly verbose
15,000 lines of Fortran 90/77. In the year 2000, M. Marques (aka
Hyllios, aka Anto'nio de Faria, corsa'rio portugue^s), joined the A.
Rubio group in Valladolid as a postdoc. Having to use "tddft" for his
work, and being petulant enough to think he could structure the code
better than his predecessors, he started a major rewrite of the code
together with A. Castro, finishing version 0.2 of "tddft." But things
were still not perfect: due to their limited experience in Fortran 90,
and due to the inadequacy of this language for anything beyond a HELLO
WORLD program, several parts of the code were still clumsy. Also the
idea of GPLing the almost 20,000 lines arose during an alcoholic
evening. So after several weeks of fantic coding and after getting rid
of the Numerical Recipes code that still lingered around, `octopus' was
born.

   The present released version has been completely rewritten and keeps
very little relation to the old version (even input and output files)
and has been enhanced with major new flags to perform various
excited-state dynamics in finite and extended systems (one-dimensional
periodic chains). The code will be updated frequently and new versions
can be found here (http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus).

   The main features of the present version are described in detail in
_octopus: a first principles tool for excited states electron-ion
dynamics_, Comp. Phys. Comm. *151*, 60 (2003).  Updated references as
well as results obtained with octopus will be posted regularly to the
`octopus' web page. If you find the code useful for you research we
would appreciate if you give reference to this work and previous ones.

   If you have some free time, and if you feel like taking a joy ride
with Fortran 90, just drop us an email <octopus@tddft.org>. You can
also send us patches, comments, ideas, wishes, etc. They will be
included in new releases of octopus.

3 Installation
**************

Maybe somebody else installed the `octopus'  for you. In that case, the
files should be under some directory that we can call `PREFIX': the
executables in `PREFIX/bin' (e.g. if `PREFIX=/usr/local', the main
`octopus' executable is then `/usr/local/bin/octopus'); the
documentation in `info' format in `PREFIX/info' (so that you may see it
by typing `info -f PREFIX/info/octopus.info' if the `info' program is
installed in your system); some sample files in
`PREFIX/share/octopus/samples'; the pseudopotential files that
`octopus'  will need in `PREFIX/share/octopus/PP', etc.

   However, you may be unlucky and that is not the case. In the
following we will try to help you with the, still rather unfriendly,
task of compiling and installing the `octopus'  .

* Quick instructions::
* Long instructions::
* Different octopus executables::


File: octopus.info,  Node: Quick instructions,  Next: Long instructions,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

3.1 Quick instructions
======================

For the inpatients, here goes the quick-start:
     prompt> gzip -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     prompt> cd octopus-<version>
     prompt> ./configure
     prompt> make
     prompt> make install

   This will probably *not* work, so before giving up, just read the
following paragraphs.

   Also, rpm and deb binaries for linux are supplied on the web-page.


File: octopus.info,  Node: Long instructions,  Next: Different octopus executables,  Prev: Quick instructions,  Up: Installation

3.2 Long instructions
=====================

The code is written in standard Fortran 90, with some routines written
in C (and in bison, if we count the input parser). To build it you will
need both a C compiler (`gcc' works just fine), and a Fortran 90
compiler. No free-software Fortran 90 compiler is available yet, so, if
you want to chew the `octopus', you will have either to help the g95
(http://g95.sourceforge.net) or gfortran (http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran)
projects, or use any of the available comercial compilers.

   Besides the compiler, you will also need:
  1. `make':  most computers have it installed, otherwise just grab and
     install the GNU `make'.

  2. `cpp': The C preprocessor is heavily used in `octopus'.  GNU `cpp'
     is just fine, but any `cpp' that accepts the `-C' flag (preserve
     comments) should work just as well.

  3. FFTW: We have relied on this great library to perform the Fast
     Fourier Transforms (FFTs). You may grab it from here
     (http://www.fftw.org/).  You may use FFTW version 2 as well as
     FFTW version 3. `octopus' will try first to use the latter one,
     since it is significantly faster in some architectures.

  4. LAPACK/BLAS: Required. Our politics is to rely on these two
     libraries as much as possible on these libraries for the linear
     algebra operations.  If you are running Linux, there is a fair
     chance they are already installed in your system. The same goes to
     the more heavyweight machines (alphas, IBMs, SGIs, etc.).
     Otherwise, just grab the source from here (http://www.netlib.org).

  5. GSL: Finally that someone had the nice idea of making a public
     scientific library! GSL still needs to grow, but it is already
     quite useful and impressive.  `octopus' uses splines, complex
     numbers, special functions, etc. from GSL, so it is a must! If you
     don't have it already installed in your system, you can obtain GSL
     from here (http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/). You will need version
     1.0 or higher.

  6. MPI: If you want to run `octopus' in multi-tentacle (parallel)
     mode, you will need an implementation of MPI.  MPICH
     (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/) works just fine in our
     Linux boxes.


   First you should obtain the code file, `octopus<-version>.tar.gz',
(this you probably have already done). The code is freely available, and
can be downloaded from `http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus'. There
exists a `cvs' server, which you can browse at
`http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/marques/octopus/'.  The
sources of the cvs version (in general more unstable the the _official_
distribution) may be downloaded by anonymous cvs access:

     prompt> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@nautilus.fis.uc.pt:/server/cvsroot
             login

     prompt> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@nautilus.fis.uc.pt:/server/cvsroot
             co marques/octopus

   Uncompress and untar it (`gzip -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz | tar
-xvf -').  In the following, `OCTOPUS-HOME' denotes the home directory
of octopus, created by the `tar' command.

   The `OCTOPUS-HOME' contains the following subdirectories:
   * `autom4te.cache, build, CVS, debian': contains files related to
     the building system or the CVS repository. May actually not be
     there.  Not of real interest for the plain user.

   * `doc': The documentation of `octopus' in _texinfo_ format.

   * `liboct': Small C library that handles the interface to GSL and
     the parsing of the input file. It also contains some assorted
     routines that we didn't want to write in boring Fortran.

   * `share/PP': Pseudopotentials.  In practice now it contains the
     Troullier-Martins and Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter pseudopotential
     files.

   * `share/util': Currently, the _utilities_ include a couple of IBM
     OpenDX networks (`wf.net'), to visualize wavefunctions, densities,
     etc.

   * `share/samples': A couple of sample input files.

   * `src': Fortran 90 source files. Note that these have to be
     preprocessed before being fed to the Fortran compiler, so do not
     be scared by all the # directives.

   Before configuring you can (should) setup a couple of options.
Although the configure script tries to guess your system settings for
you, we recommend that you set explicitly the default Fortran compiler
and the compiler options.  For example, in `bash' you would typically
do:
     export FC=abf90
     export FCFLAGS="-O -YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_"
   if you are using the Absoft Fortran 90 compiler on a linux machine.
Also, if you have some of the required libraries in some unusual
directories, these directories may be placed in the variable `LDFLAGS'
(e.g., `export LDFLAGS=$LDFLAGS:/opt/lib/').

   The configuration script will try to find out which compiler you are
using.  Unfortunately, and due to the nature of the primitive language
that `octopus' is programmed in, the automatic test fails very often.
Often it is better to set the variable `FCFLAGS' by hand. These are
some of the options reported to work:
`intel ifc (PIV)'
     `-u -zero -fpp1 -nbs -i_dynamic -pc80 -pad -align  -unroll -O3 -r8
     -ip -tpp7 -xW'

`absoft (i386)'
     `-O3 -YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_'

`absoft (opteron)'
     `-O3 -mcmodel=medium -m64 -cpu:host -YEXT_NAMES=LCS -YEXT_SFX=_'

`NAG (opteron)'
     `-colour -kind=byte -mismatch_all -abi=64 -ieee=full -O4
     -Ounroll=4'

`pgi (opteron)'
     `-fast -mcmodel=medium -O4'

`alpha'
     `-align dcommons -fast -tune host -arch host -noautomatic'

`xlf (IBM)'
     `-bmaxdata:0x80000000 -qmaxmem=-1 -qsuffix=f=f90 -Q -O5 -qstrict
     -qtune=auto -qarch=auto -qhot -qipa'

`sgi'
     `-O3 -INLINE -n32 -LANG:recursive=on'

   You can now run the configure script (`./configure').  (1) You can
use a fair amount of options to spice `octopus' to your own taste.  To
obtain a full list just type `./configure --help'. Some commonly used
options include:
   * `--prefix=PREFIX': Change the base installation dir of `octopus'
     to `PREFIX'. The executable will be installed in `PREFIX/bin', the
     libraries in `PREFIX/lib' and the documentation in `PREFIX/info'.
     `PREFIX' defaults to the home directory of the user who runs
     `configure'.  (2)

   * `--with-fft=fftw2': Instruct the `configure' script to use the FFTW
     library, and specifically to use the FFTW version 2. You may also
     set `--with-fft=fftw3' or even `--disable-fft', although this last
     option is dis-encouraged.

   * `--with-fft-lib=<lib>': Instruct the `configure' script to look
     for the FFTW library exactly in the way that it is specified in
     the `<lib>' argument, i.e `--with-fft-lib='-L/opt/lib -lfftw3''.

   * `--with-blas=<lib>': Instruct the `configure' script to look for
     the BLAS library in the way that it is specified in the `<lib>'
     argument.

   * `--with-lapack=<lib>': Instruct the `configure' script to look for
     the BLAS library in the way that it is specified in the `<lib>'
     argument.

   * `--with-gsl-prefix=DIR': Installation directory of the GSL
     library. The libraries are expected to be in `DIR/lib' and the
     include files in `DIR/include'. The value of `DIR' is usually
     found by issuing the command `gsl-config --prefix'. (If the GSL
     library is installed, the program `gsl-config' should be
     somewhere.)

   * `--with-netcdf=<lib>': NETCDF library. This is a recommended
     library, although not necessary.

   In addition to these options, several other options have to be
passed to build different executables of octopus (parallel, debugging
version, etc) - *Note Different octopus executables::.

   Run `make', and then `make install'. If everything went fine, you
should now be able to taste `octopus'. Depending on the options passed
to the configure script, some suffixes could be added to the generic
name `octopus' -- i.e. `octopus_cmplx' for the code compiled for
complex wave-functions, `octopus_cmplx_mpi' for a parallel version of
the code compiled for complex wave-function, and so on.

   Depending on the value given to the `--prefix=PREFIX' given, the
executables will reside in `PREFIX/bin', the info file with the
documentation in `PREFIX/info' (so that it may be viewed running `info
-f PREFIX/info/octopus.info'), and the auxiliary files will be copied
to `PREFIX/share/octopus'. The sample input files will be copied to
`PREFIX/share/octopus/samples'.

   The program has been tested in the following platforms:
   * `i686*-linux-gnu': with the Absoft (http://www.absoft.com),   and
     the Intel (http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/)
     compiler.

   * `alphae*': both in Linux and in OSF/1 with Compaq's `fort'
     compiler.

   * `powerpc-ibm-aix4.3.3.0': with native `xlf90' compiler.

   * `cray': with native f90 compiler.

   * `opteron': with NAG, PGI, and ABSOFT compilers.

   * `SGI': with native compiler.
   If you manage to compile/run `octopus' on a different platform or
with a different compiler, please let us know so we can update the
list. Patches to solve compiler issues are also welcomed.

   Build the documentation in the format you prefer. Since you are
reading this, you already have it in some format (but maybe not the
correct version).  Due to the power of `texinfo', a series of formats
are available, namely `dvi', `html', `pdf' and `info'. The
`octopus.texi' source code of this document is in the
`OCTOPUS-HOME/doc' directory.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you downloaded the cvs version, you will not find the
`configure' script.  In order to compile the development version you
will first have to run the GNU autotools.  This may be done by
executing the `autoreconf' perl script (a part of the `autoconf'
distribution).  Note that you need to have working versions of the
`automake' (1.8.5), `autoconf' (2.59) and `libtool' (1.5.6) programs
(the versions we currently use are between parentheses). Note that the
`autoreconf' script will likely fail if you have (much) older versions
of the autotools.

   (2) You may fine-tune further the instalation by making use of a set
of standard options (`--exec-prefix, --bindir, --datadir,
--program-prefix', etc) that are described in the output of
`./configure --help'

3.3 Different octopus executables
=================================

By performing the standard install, you will get an executable called
`octopus', and a set of utility programs called `oct-'_something_.
However, the code may be compiled differently in order to profit from
special feautures (e.g parallel executables, etc). The following is a
list of the options that have to be passed to the `configure' script in
order to obtain these different executables.

   * `--enable-complex': Builds a version with complex wave-functions
     for the ground-state calculations (wave-functions are always
     complex for the evolution). This is needed when spinors are needed
     -- e.g. noncollinear magnetism is going to be considered, or the
     spin-orbit coupling term will be used. The suffix `_cmplx' is
     appended to the `octopus' executable name.

   * `--enable-single': Builds a version that works in single precision
     mode, rather than in the standard double precision. It will work
     faster.  Unfortunately we are not yet fully sure of the proper
     functioning of the code in this manner.  The suffix `_single' is
     appended to the `octopus' executable name.  (This is currently
     broken).

   * `--enable-mpi': Builds the parallel version (MPI) of `octopus'.
     The suffix `_mpi' is appended to the `octopus' executable name.

4 The parser
************

All input options should be in a file called "`inp'", in the directory
`octopus' is run from. Alternatively, if this file is not found,
standard input is read. For a fairly comprehensive example, just look
at the file `OCTOPUS_HOME/share/samples/Na2' -- if you installed the
code (you did the `make install'), this file will also be in
`PREFIX/share/octopus/samples/Na2'.

   At the beginning of the program `liboct' reads the input file,
parses it, and generates a list of variables that will be read by
`octopus' (note that the input is case independent).  There are two
kind of variables, scalar values (strings or numbers), and blocks (that
you may view as matrices). A scalar variable `var' can be defined by:
     var = exp
   `var' can contain any alphanumeric character plus "_", and `exp' can
be a quote delimited string, a number (integer, real, or complex), a
variable name, or a mathematical expression.  In the expressions all
arithmetic operators are supported ("a+b", "a-b", "a*b", "a/b"; for
exponentiation the C syntax "a^b" is used), and the following functions
can be used:
   * `sqrt(x)': The square root of `x'.

   * `exp(x)': The exponential of `x'.

   * `log(x)' or `ln(x)': The natural logarithm of `x'.

   * `log10(x)': Base 10 logarithm of `x'.

   * `sin(x)', `cos(x)', `tan(x)', `cot(x)',   `sec(x)', `csc(x)': The
     sinus, co-sinus, tangent, co-tangent,   secant and co-secant of
     `x'.

   * `asin(x)', `acos(x)', `atan(x)', `acot(x)',   `asec(x)',
     `acsc(x)': The inverse (arc-) sinus, co-sinus, tangent, co-tangent,
      secant and co-secant of `x'.

   * `sinh(x)', `cosh(x)', `tanh(x)', `coth(x)',   `sech(x)',
     `csch(x)': The hyperbolic sinus, co-sinus, tangent, co-tangent,
     secant and co-secant of `x'.

   * `asinh(x)', `acosh(x)', `atanh(x)', `acoth(x)',   `asech(x)',
     `acsch(x)': The inverse hyperbolic sinus, co-sinus, tangent,
     co-tangent,   secant and co-secant of `x'.
   You can also use any of the predefined variables:
   * `pi': 3.141592653589793, what else is there to say?

   * `e': The base of the natural logarithms.

   * `false' or `f' or `no': False in all its flavors. For the
     curious, `false' is defined as 0.

   * `true' or `t' or `yes': The truthful companion of `false'. For the
      curious, `true' is defined as 1.

   Blocks are defined as a collection of values, organised in row and
column format.  The syntax is the following:
     %var
       exp | exp | exp | ...
       exp | exp | exp | ...
       ...
     %
   Rows in a block are separated by a newline, while columns are
separated by the character "|" or by a tab. There may be any number of
lines and any number of columns in a block. Note also that each line
can have a different number of columns.

   If `octopus' tries to read a variable that is not defined in the
input file, it automatically assigns to it a default value. All
variables read are output to the file "`out.oct'". If you are not sure
of what the program is reading, just take a look at it.  Everything
following the character "#" until the end of the line is considered a
comment and is simply cast into oblivion.

========

`octopus' uses a grid in real space to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
The grid is equally-spaced, but the spacings can be different for each
Cartesian direction. The shape of the simulation region may also be
tuned to suit the geometric configuration of the system.

The ground-state electronic density in a Kohn-Sham (KS) based
electronic structure code such as `octopus'  is obtained after a
self-consistent process that attempts to solve the KS equations.  In
essence, the problem is the following: at a given iteration step, one
departs from an approximated solution - some KS eigenfunctions
\psi^inp_j, eigenvalues \epsilon^inp_j and density \rho^inp, which
determines a KS "input" Hamiltonian. By diagonalizing this Hamiltonian,
one obtains the corresponding "output" eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and
density.  This cycle is considered to be closed, and the solution
achieved, when some convergence criterion is fulfilled.  In our case,
we have allowed for four different criteria, to be defined below.  The
self consistent procedure will stop when the first of the convergence
criteria is fulfilled, or either when a a maximum number of iterations
has been performed.

5.3 Run Mode Unoccupied States
==============================

These variables are only used in `CalculationMode == unocc,
unocc_start'. The purpose of these run modes is to calculate higher
lying Kohn-Sham orbitals. For that purpose, it reads the restart
information from a converged previous ground-state calculation, and
builds the corresponding Hamiltonian. Then, it calculates the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that are requested by the user.

   Note: These variables are also used in `CalculationMode = td' or
`td_start' if `TDOccupationalAnalysis == 1').

5.4 Run Mode Time Dependent
===========================

When `CalculationMode = (td | td_start)', the code performs the time
propagation of the electronic orbitals and - if required - of the ionic
positions. This latter task does not pose major algorithmical problems
(the usual Verlet algorithms deal with that task); however the best way
to propagate a Schro"dinger-like equation is still unclear. Due to this
fact, we provide with a rather excessive selection of possibilities for
that purpose. Before describing the set of variables necessary to
specify the way in which the time evolution is to be performed, it is
worth making a brief introduction to the problem.

   We are concerned with a set of Schro"dinger-like equations for the
electronic orbitals:

   i{\partial psi_i \over \partial t} = H(t)\psi_i(t)\,,

   \psi_i(t=0) = \psi_i^0\,.

   Being the equation linear, one may formally define a linear
"evolution" operator, which trasforms the initial vector into the
solution at time T:

   \psi_i(T) = U(T, 0)\psi_i^0

   Moreover, there is a formal exact expression for the evolution
operator:

   \psi_i(T) = T\exp\lbrace -i\!\!\int_0^{T}d\tau H(\tau)\rbrace
\psi_i^0\,.

   where T\exp is the time-ordered exponential. If the Hamiltonian
conmutes with itself at different times, we can drop the time-ordering
product, and leave a simple exponential.  If the Hamiltonian is
time-independent - which makes it trivially self commuting, the
solution is then simply written as:

   \psi_i(T) = \exp\lbrace -iTH\rbrace \psi_i^0\,.

   Unfortunately, this is not the case in general. We have to find an
algorithm able to cope with time-dependent Hamiltonians, such as the
self-consistent time-dependent Kohn-Sham operator, which is built "self
consistently" from the varying electronic density.

   The first step is to perform a time-discretization: the full
propagation between 0 and T is decomposed as:

   U(T,0) = \prod_{i=0}^{N-1}U(t_i+\delta t,t_i)\,,

   where t_0=0, t_N=T, \delta t = T/N. So at each time step we are
dealing with the problem of performing the short-time propagation:

   \psi_i(t+\delta t) = U(t+\delta t, t)\psi_i(t) = T\exp\lbrace
-i\!\!\int_{t}^{t+\delta t}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!d\tau\,H(\tau)\rbrace
\psi(t)\,.

   In this way, one can monitor the evolution in the interior of [0,t].
In fact, the possibility of monitoring the evolution is generally a
requirement; this requirement imposes a natural restriction on the
maximum size of \delta t: if \omega_\rm max is the maximum frequency
that we want to discern, \delta t should be no larger than \approx
1/\omega_\rm max.  Below this \delta t_\rm max, we are free to choose
\delta t considering performance reasons: Technically, the reason for
the discretization is twofold: the time-dependence of H is alleviated,
and the norm of the exponential argument is reduced (the norm increases
linearly with \delta t).

   Since we cannot drop the time-ordering product, the desired algorithm
cannot be reduced, in principle, to the calculation of the action of
the exponential of an operator over the initial vector.  Some
algorithms tailored to approximate the evolution operator, in fact, do
not even require to peform such operator exponentials.  Most of them,
however, do rely on the calculation of one or more exponentials, such
as the ones used by `octopus'. This is why in principle we need to
specify two different issues: the "evolution method", and the
"exponential method". In other words: we need an algorithm to
approximate the evolution operator U(t+\delta t, t) - which will be
specified by variable `TDEvolutionMethod' - and, if this algorithm
requires it, we will also need an algorithm to approximate the
exponential of a matrix operator \exp\lbrace A\rbrace - which will be
specified by variable `TDExponentialMethod'.

5.5 Function output for visualization
=====================================

Every given number of time iterations, or after ground-state
calculations, some of the functions that characterise the system may be
written to disk so that they may be analized. Files are written within
"static" output directory after the self-consistent field, or within
"td.x" directories, during evolution, where "x" stands for the
iteration number at which each write is done.  Note that if you wish to
plot any function (`OutputKSPotential = yes', etc.), at least one of
the output formats should be enabled (`OutputPlaneX = yes', `OutputDX =
yes', `OutputNETCDF = yes', etc.). [This is not necessary if you wish
to plot the geometry (`OutputGeometry = yes')]. Note further that the
data written by `OutputAxisX', `OutputPlaneX' etc. has always the
(side) length of the longest axis; this is independent from the  chosen
geometry. Data points which are inexistent in the actual geometry have
the value zero in those files.

5.6 Spectrum calculations
=========================

Once `octopus' has been run, results must be analyzed somehow. The most
common thing is to Fourier-transform something to calculate spectra.
This may be done through some utilities (`strength-function',
`hs-from-mult', `hs-from-acc' which are described in section "External
utilities." Common options read by these utilities are:

6.1.1 Debug
-----------

   * *DebugLevel*
     _Section_: Generalities::Debug
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: 1
     This variable decides wether or not to enter debug-mode. In
     debugging mode,  the program prints to standard error when it
     enters and exits the subroutines,  what is the memory it is using
     (only, for the moment being, in Linux systems),  and some other
     information. Useful for developers, and mandatory if you want  to
     send a bug report to the developers and being considered.   You
     have two options: (i) setting it to zero - or less than zero, in
     which  case you do not run in debugging mode (this is the
     default), or (ii) setting  it to a positive number. In this case
     the entries and exits to nested subroutines  are only printed down
     to the level that is given in this variable.

   * *DevelVersion*
     _Section_: Generalities::Debug
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     If true, allows the use of certains parts of the code that are
     still under development. This should not be used for production
     runs.

   * *MPIDebugHook*
     _Section_: Generalities::Debug
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     When debugging the code in parallel it is usually difficult to
     find the origin  of race conditions that appear in MPI
     communications. This variable introduces  a facility to control
     separate MPI processes. If set to yes, all nodes will  start up,
     but will get trapped in an endless loop. In every cycle of the loop
     each node is sleeping for one second and is then checking if a
     file with the  name node_hook.xxx (where xxx denotes the node
     number) exists. A given node can  only be released from the loop
     if the corresponding file is created. This allows  to selectively
     run eg. a compute node first followed by the master node. Or, by
     reversing the file creation of the node hooks, to run the master
     first followed  by a compute node.

   * *ProfilingMode*
     _Section_: Generalities::Debug
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     Use this variable to run octopus in profiling mode. In this mode
     octopus records time spent in certain areas of the code and  the
     number of times this code is executed. These numbers  are written
     in './profiling.NNN/profiling.nnn' with nnn being the  node number
     (000 in serial) and NNN the number of processors.   This is mainly
     for development purposes. Note, however, that  octopus should be
     compiled with -disable-debug to do proper  profiling.

6.1.2 IO
--------

   * *FlushMessages*
     _Section_: Generalities::IO
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     In addition to writing to stdout and stderr, the code messages may
     also be  flushed to "messages.stdout" and "messages.stderr", if
     this variable is  set to yes.

   * *RestartFileFormat*
     _Section_: Generalities::IO
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: restart_plain
     Determines in which format the restart file should be written

     _Options_:
        - *restart_plain* (1):  Binary (platform dependent) format

        - *restart_netcdf* (2):  NetCDF (platform independent) format.
          This requires the NETCDF library.

   * *WorkDir*
     _Section_: Generalities::IO
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "."
     By default, all files are written and read from the working
     directory,  i.e. the directory from which the executable was
     launched. This behavior can  be changed by setting this variable:
     if you give it a name (other than ".")   the files are written and
     read in that directory.

   * *stderr*
     _Section_: Generalities::IO
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "-"
     The standard error by default goes to, well, to standard error.
     This can  be changed by setting this variable: if you give it a
     name (other than "-")  the output stream is printed in that file
     instead.

   * *stdout*
     _Section_: Generalities::IO
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "-"
     The standard output by default goes to, well, to standard output.
     This can  be changed by setting this variable: if you give it a
     name (other than "-")  the output stream is printed in that file
     instead.

6.1.3 Parallel
--------------

   * *ParallelizationGroupRanks*
     _Section_: Generalities::Parallel
     _Type_: block
     Specifies the size of the groups used for the parellization. For
     example  (n_d, n_s, n_k) means we have n_p*n_s*n_k processors and
     that the k-points  should be divided in n_k groups, the states in
     n_s groups, and each state  in n_d domains.

   * *ParallelizationStrategy*
     _Section_: Generalities::Parallel
     _Type_: flag
     _Default_: par_domains + par_states + par_kpoints
     Specifies what kind of parallelization strategy octopus should use.
     The values can be combined, for example "par_domains + par_states"
     means a combined parallelization in domains and states

     _Options_:
        - *serial*:  Octopus will run in serial.

        - *par_domains* (1):  Octopus will run parallel in domains.

        - *par_states* (2):  Octopus will run parallel in states.

        - *par_kpoints* (4):  Octopus will run parallel in
          k-points/spin.

        - *par_other* (8):  Run-mode dependent. For example, in casida
          it means parallelization in e-h pairs

6.1.4 Units
-----------

   * *Units*
     _Section_: Generalities::Units
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "a.u"
     Atomic units seem to be the preferred system in the atomic and
     molecular physics community (despite the opinion of some of the
     authors  of this program). Internally, the code works in atomic
     units. However,  for input or output, some people like using eV
     for energies and AA for  lengths. This other system of units can
     also be used.

     _Options_:
        - *"a.u"*:  Atomic units

        - *"eVA"*:  Electron-volts for energy, Angstrom for length.

   * *UnitsInput*
     _Section_: Generalities::Units
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "a.u"
     Same as "Units", but only refers to the values in the input files.
     That  is, if UnitsInput = "eVA", all physical values in the input
     files  will be considered to be in eV and Angstroms.

   * *UnitsOutput*
     _Section_: Generalities::Units
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "a.u"
     Same as "Units", but only refers to the values in the output
     files.  That  is, if UnitsInput = "eVA", all physical values in
     the output files  will be considered to be in eV and Angstroms.

     Even if previous convergence criterium is not satisfied,
     minimization will stop  after this number of iterations.

   * *GOMethod*
     _Section_: Geometry Optimization
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: steep
     Method by which the minimization is performed.

     _Options_:
        - *steep* (1):  simple steepest descent.

   * *GOStep*
     _Section_: Geometry Optimization

6.3 Hamiltonian
===============

   * *AtomsMagnetDirection*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: block
     This option is only used when GuessMagnetDensity is set to
     user_defined. It provides a direction for each atoms magnetization
     vector when building the guess density. In order to do that the
     user should  specify the coordinates of a vector that has the
     desired direction. The norm  of the vector is ignored. Note that
     it is necessaty to maintain the  ordering in which the species
     were defined in the coordinates specifications.

     For spin-polarized calculations the vectors should have only one
     component and  for non-collinear spin calculations they should
     have three components.

   * *ClassicPotential*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: integer
     If true, add to the external potential the potential generated by
     the point charges read from the PDB input (see PBDCoordinates).

     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: 2.0023193043768
     The gyromagnetic ratio of the electron. This is of course a
     physical  constant, and the default value is the exact one that
     you should not  touch, unless :

     (i)  You want to disconnect the anomalous Zeeman term in the
     Hamiltonian  (then set it to zero, this number only affects this
     term);

     (ii) You are using an effective Hamiltonian, as it is the case when
     you calculate a 2D electron gas, in which case you have an
     effective  gyromagnetic factor that dependes on the material.

   * *MultigridLevels*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: integer
     Number of levels in the grid hierachy used for multigrid. Positive
     numbers indicate an absolute numbers of levels, negative  numbers
     are substracted to maximum number of levels posible for  the grid
     been used. Default is the maximum number of levels for  the grid.

     _Options_:

          the grid.

   * *NonInteractingElectrons*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     Sometimes it may be helpful to treat the electrons as
     non-interacting particles,  i.e., not to take into account Hartree
     and exchange-correlation effects between  the electrons. This
     variable may be used to toogle this behavior on and off

     _Options_:
        - *no*:  Electrons are treated as *interacting* particles

        - *yes* (1):  Electrons are handled as *non-interacting*
          paticles

   * *RelativisticCorrection*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: non_relativistic
     The default value means that _no_ relativistic correction is used.
     To  include spin-orbit coupling turn RelativisticCorrection to
     spin_orbit  (this will only work when using an executable compiled
     for complex wave-functions,  and if SpinComponents has been set to
     non_collinear, which ensures  the use of spinors).

     _Options_:
        - *non_relativistic*:  No relativistic corrections.

        - *spin_orbit* (1):  Spin-Orbit.

        - *app_zora* (2):  Approximated ZORA (Not implemented)

     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: block
     A static constant electrical field may be added to the usual
     Hamiltonian,  by setting the block StaticElectricField. Atomic
     units will be assumed  always for its magnitude, regardless of the
     unit system specified.   The three possible components of the
     block (which should only have one  line) are the three components
     of the electrical field vector.

   * *StaticMagneticField*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: block
     A static constant magnetic field may be added to the usual
     Hamiltonian,  by setting the block StaticMagneticField. Atomic
     units will be assumed  always for its magnitude, regardless of the
     unit system specified.   The three possible components of the
     block (which should only have one  line) are the three components
     of the magnetic field vector. Note that  if you are running the
     code in 1D mode this will not work, and if you  are running the
     code in 2D mode the magnetic field will have to be in  the
     z-direction, so that the first two columns should be zero.

   * *VlocalCutoff*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: value of PeriodicDimensions
     Define which cutoff type is to be applied to the long range part
     of the local potential  A cutoff is used when one wants to avoid
     the long range interactions  among the system enclosed in the
     simulation box and (some of) its periodic images

        - *cutoff_cylinder* (1):  Cut off the interaction out of a
          cylinder with axis parallel to the x direction

        - *cutoff_slab* (2):  Cut off the interaction out of a slab in
          the xy plane

        - *cutoff_none* (3):  Do not apply any cutoff: all the periodic
          images interact

   * *VlocalCutoffRadius*
     _Section_: Hamiltonian
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: value of the largest nonperiodic box length
     The maximum length out of which the long range part of the
     interaction  is cut off.   It refers to the radius of the cylinder
     if VlocalCutoff = 1,  to the thickness od the slab if VlocalCutoff
     = 2.

   * *LinearResponseKohnShamStates*
     _Section_: Linear Response::Casida
     _Type_: string
     The calculation of the excitation spectrum of a system in the
     frequency-domain  formulation of linear-response time-dependent
     density functional theory (TDDFT)  implies the use of a basis set
     of occupied/unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. This  basis set should,
     in principle, include all pairs formed by all occupied states,
     and an infinite number of unoccupied states. In practice, one has
     to truncate this  basis set, selecting a number of occupied and
     unoccupied states that will form the  pairs. These states are
     specified with this variable. If there are, say, 10 occupied
     states, and one sets this variable to the value "10-18", this
     means that occupied  states from 10 to 15, and unoccupied states
     from 16 to 18 will be considered.

     This variable is a string in list form, i.e. expressions such as
     "1,2-5,8-15" are  valid. You should include a non-null number of
     unoccupied states and a non-null number  of occupied states.

   * *LinearResponseTransitionDensities*
     _Section_: Linear Response::Casida
     _Type_: string
     Specifies which transition densities are to be calculated and
     written down. The  transition density for the many-body state n
     will be written to a file called  linear/rho0n.

     By default, no transition density is calculated. Note that you
     must also set  the output variable to contain the flat
     "transition_density", in order for this  to work.

     This variable is a string in list form, i.e. expressions such as
     "1,2-5,8-15" are  valid.

     rectangular grid (standard mode),  or else an *adaptive* or

     This number determines the region over which the grid is enhanced

     this variable. [This is the a_\alpha  variable in Eq. 2 of F. Gygi

     expression of the differential operator.

     If curvilinear coordinates are to be used, then only the
     "stencil_starplus"  or the "stencil_cube" may be used. We only

     For solving Poisson equation in Fourier space, and for applying
     the local potential  in Fourier space, an auxiliary cubic mesh is
     built. This mesh will be larger than  the circumscribed cube to
     the usual mesh by a factor DoubleFFTParameter. See  the section

     as possible: some points may be added to each direction in order
     to get a "good number"  for the performance of the FFT algorithm.

     %Lsize
     sizex | sizey | sizez
     %

     where the "size*" are half the lengths of the box in each
     direction.

     If BoxShape is "parallelpiped", this block has to be defined in
     the input file. The  number of columns must match the
     dimensionality of the calculation.

   * *PeriodicDimensions*
     _Section_: Mesh::Simulation Box
     _Type_: integer
     Define which directions are to be considered periodic. Of course,
     it has to be a number  from 0 to three, and it cannot be larger
     than Dimensions.

     _Options_:
        - *0*:  No direction is periodic (molecule)

        - *1*:  The x direction is periodic (wire)

        - *2*:  The x and y directions are periodic (slab)

        - *3*:  The x, y, and z directions are periodic (bulk)

   * *Radius*
     _Section_: Mesh::Simulation Box
     _Type_: float
     If BoxShape is not "parallelepiped" defines the radius of the
     spheres or of the cylinder.   It has to be a positive number. If
     it is not defined in the input file, then the program  will
     attempt to fine a suitable default, but this is not always
     possible, in which case  the code will stop issuing this error
     message.

   * *Spacing*
     _Section_: Mesh::Simulation Box
     _Type_: float
     The spacing between the points in the mesh. In case of using
     curvilinear  coordinates, this is a canonical spacing that will be
     changed locally by the  transformation.

     It is possible to have a different spacing in each one of the
     cartesian directions  if we define Spacing as block of the form

     %Spacing
     spacing_x | spacing_y | spacing_z
     %

   * *Xlength*
     _Section_: Mesh::Simulation Box
     _Type_: float
     If BoxShape is "cylinder", it is half the total length of the
     cylinder.

          numbering of mesh points. Since this mode produces large
          datafiles this is only  useful for small meshes and debugging
          purposes.   The output can also be used to display the mesh
          directly. A gnuplot script for mesh vizualization  can be
          found under PREFIX/share/octopus/util/display_mesh_index.gp

        - *dx* (64):  For printing all the three dimensional
          information, the open source program  visualization tool
          OpenDX (http://www.opendx.org/) is used. The string  ".dx" is

6.6 SCF
=======

   * *GuessMagnetDensity*
     _Section_: SCF
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: ferromagnetic
     The guess density for the SCF cycle is just the sum of all the
     atomic densities.   When performing spin-polarized or
     non-collinear spin calculations this option sets  the guess
     magnetization density.

     For anti-ferromagnetic configurations the user_defined option
     should be used.

     Note that if the paramagnetic option is used the final
     ground-state will also be  paramagnetic, but the same is not true
     for the other options.

     _Options_:
        - *user_defined* (123):  The atomic magnetization densities are
          rotated so that the magnetization  vector has the same
          direction as a vector provided by the user. In this case,
          the AtomsMagnetDirection block has to be set.

        - *paramagnetic* (1):  Magnetization density is zero.

        - *ferromagnetic* (2):  Magnetization density is the sum of the
          atomic magnetization densities.

        - *random* (3):  Each atomic magnetization density is randomly
          rotated.

   * *LCAODimension*
     _Section_: SCF
     _Type_: integer
     Before starting the SCF cycle, an initial LCAO calculation can be
     performed  in order to obtain reasonable initial guesses for
     spin-orbitals and densities.   For this purpose, the code
     calculates a number of atomic orbitals - this  number depends on
     the given species. The default dimension for the LCAO basis  set
     will be the sum of all these numbers, unless this dimension is
     larger than  twice the number of required orbitlas for the full
     calculation.

     This dimension however can be reduced (never increased) by making
     use of the  variable LCAODimension. Note that LCAODimension cannot
     be smaller than the  number of orbitals needed in the full
     calculation - if LCAODimension is smaller,  it will be changed
     silently increased to meet this requirement. In the same way,  if
     LCAODimension is larger than the available number of atomic
     orbitals,  it will be reduced. If you want to use the largest
     possible number, set  LCAODimension to a negative number.

   * *LCAOStart*
     _Section_: SCF
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: lcao_states
     Before starting a SCF calculation, octopus can perform  a LCAO
     calculation. These can provide octopus with a good set  of initial
     wave-functions and with a new guess for the density.   (Up to
     current version, only a minimal basis set used.)

     _Options_:
        - *lcao_none*:  Do not perform a LCAO calculation before the
          SCF cycle.

        - *lcao_states* (1):  Do a LCAO calculation before the SCF
          cycle and use the resulting wave-functions as  initail
          wave-functions without changing the guess density.   This
          will speed-up the convergence of the eigensolver during the
          first SCF iterations.

        - *lcao_full* (2):  Do a LCAO calculation before the SCF cycle
          and use the LCAO wave-functions to build a new  guess density
          and a new KS potential.   Using the LCAO density as a new
          guess density may improve the convergence, but can  also slow
          it down or yield wrong results (especially for spin-polarized
          calculations).

   * *SCFinLCAO*
     _Section_: SCF
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     Performs all the SCF cycle restricting the calculation to the LCAO
     subspace.   This may be useful for systems with convergence
     problems (first do a  calculation within the LCAO subspace, then
     restart from that point for  an unrestricted calculation).

6.7 States
==========

   * *CenterOfInversion*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: no
     Only used in 1D periodic calculation to enforce the correspondig
     symmetry in the Brillouin Zone

     _Options_:
        - *no*:  The system has no center of inversion: use the whole BZ

        - *yes* (1):  The system has a center of inversion: use half BZ

   * *ElectronicTemperature*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: 0.0
     If Occupations is not set, ElectronicTemperature is the
     temperature in the Fermi-Dirac function used to distribute the
     electrons  among the existing states.

   * *ExcessCharge*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: 0.0
     The net charge of the system. A negative value means that we are
     adding  electrons, while a positive value means we are taking
     electrons  from the system.

   * *ExtraStates*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: integer
     The number of states is in principle calculated considering the
     minimum  numbers of states necessary to hold the electrons present
     in the system.   The number of electrons is  in turn calculated
     considering the nature of the species supplied in the  Species
     block, and the value of the ExcessCharge variable.   However, one
     may command octopus to put more states, which is necessary if one
     wants to  use fractional occupational numbers, either fixed from
     the origin through  the Occupations block or by prescribing  an
     electronic temperature with ElectronicTemperature.

     Note that this number is unrelated to CalculationMode == unocc.

   * *NumberKPoints*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: block
     _Default_: 1,1,1
     A triplet of integers defining the number of kpoints to be used
     along each direction in the reciprocal space.   The numbers refer
     to the whole BZ, and the actual number of kpoints  is usually
     reduced exploiting the symmetries of the system  For example, the
     following input samples the BZ with 100 points in the  xy plane of
     the reciprocal space

     %NumberKPoints
     10 | 10 | 1
     %

   * *Occupations*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: block
     The occupation numbers of the orbitals can be fixed through the
     use of this  variable. For example:

     %Occupations
     2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0
     %

     would fix the occupations of the five states to _2.0_. There must
     be  as many columns as states in the calculation. If
     SpinComponents == polarized  this block should contain two lines,
     one for each spin channel.   This variable is very useful when
     dealing with highly symmetric small systems  (like an open shell
     atom), for it allows us to fix the occupation numbers  of
     degenerate states in order to help octopus to converge. This is to
     be used in conjuction with ExtraStates. For example, to calculate
     the  carbon atom, one would do:

     ExtraStates = 2
     %Occupations
     2 | 2/3 | 2/3 | 2/3
     %

   * *ShiftKpoints*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: block
     _Default_: 0.0,0.0,0.0
     A triplet of real numbers to shift the Monkhorst-Pack k-points
     grid from its default position

   * *SpinComponents*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: unpolarized
     The calculations may be done in three different ways:
     spin-restricted (TD)DFT (i.e., doubly  occupied "closed shells"),
     spin-unsrestricted or "spin-polarized" (TD)DFT (i.e. we have two
     electronic systes, one with spin up and one with spin down), or
     making use of two-component  spinors.

     _Options_:
        - *unpolarized* (1):  Spin-restricted calculations.

        - *spin_polarized* (2):  Spin unrestricted, also know as
          spin-DFT, SDFT. This mode will double the number of wave
          functions will double the number of wave-functions necessary
          for a spin-unpolarised  calculation.

        - *spinors* (3):  The spin-orbitals are two-component spinors.
          This effectively allows the spin-density to  arrange
          non-collinearly - i.e. the magnetization vector is allowed to
          take different  directions in different points.

   * *UserDefinedStates*
     _Section_: States
     _Type_: block
     Instead of using the ground state as initial state for  time
     propagations it might be interesting in some cases  to specify
     alternative states. Similar to user defined  potentials this block
     allows to specify formulas for  the orbitals at t=0.

     Example:

     %UserDefinedStates
     1 | 1 | 1 |  "exp(-r^2)*exp(-i*0.2*x)"
     %

     The first column specifies the component of the spinor,  the
     second column the number of the state and the third  contains
     kpoint and spin quantum numbers. Finally column  four contains a
     formula for the correspondig orbital.

     Octopus reads first the ground state orbitals from  the restart_gs
     directory. Only the states that are  specified in the above block
     will be overwritten with  the given analytical expression for the
     orbital.

6.8 System
==========

   * *SystemName*
     _Section_: System
     _Type_: string
     _Default_: "system"
     A string that identifies the current run. This parameter is
     seldomly used, but  it is sometimes useful to have in the input
     file.

6.8.1 Coordinates
-----------------

   * *Coordinates*
     _Section_: System::Coordinates
     _Type_: block
     If neither a "XYZCoordinates" nor a "PDBCoordinates" was found,
     octopus  tries to read the coordinates for the atoms from the
     block "Coordinates". The  format is quite straightforward:

     %Coordinates
     'C' |      -0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
     'O' |  0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
     %

     The first line defines a Carbon atom at coordinates ("-0.56415",
     "0.0", "0.0"),  that is _not_ allowed to move during dynamical
     simulations. The second line has  a similar meaning. This block
     obviously defines a Carbon monoxide molecule, if the  input units
     are AA. Note that in this way it is possible to fix some of the
     atoms (this  is not possible when specifying the coordinates
     through a "PDBCoordinates" or  "XYZCoordinates" file). It is
     always possible to fix _all_ atoms using the "MoveIons" directive.

   * *PDBCoordinates*
     _Section_: System::Coordinates
     _Type_: string
     If this variable is present, the program tries to read the atomic
     coordinates  from the file specified by its value. The PDB
     (Protein Data Bank  (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/)) format is quite
     complicated, and it goes  well beyond the scope of this manual.
     You can find a comprehensive  description in <a
     href='http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html'>here</a>.
     From the plethora of instructions defined in the PDB standard,
     octopus  only reads two, "ATOM" and "HETATOM". From these fields,
     it reads:
        *  columns 13-16: The specie; in fact "octopus" only cares
          about the  first letter - "CA" and "CB" will both refer to
          Carbon - so elements whose  chemical symbol has more than one
          letter can not be represented in this way.   So, if you want
          to run mercury ("Hg") please use one of the other two
          methods_m  to input the coordinates, "XYZCoordinates" or
          "Coordinates".

        *  columns 18-21: The residue. If residue is "QM", the atom is
          treated in Quantum  Mechanics, otherwise it is simply treated
          as an external classical point charge.   Its charge will be
          given by columns 61-65.

        *  columns 31-54: The Cartesian coordinates. The Fortran format
          is "(3f8.3)".

        *  columns 61-65: Classical charge of the atom. The Fortran
          format is "(f6.2)".

   * *XYZCoordinates*
     _Section_: System::Coordinates
     _Type_: string
     If "PDBCoordinates" is not present, the program reads the atomic
     coordinates from  the XYZ file specified by the variable
     "XYZCoordinates" - in case this variable  is present. The XYZ
     format is very simple:  The first line of the file has an integer
     indicating the number of atoms. The second can contain comments
     that are simply ignored by  "octopus". Then there follows one line
     per each atom, containing the chemical species and  the Cartesian
     coordinates of the atom.

6.8.2 Species
-------------

   * *Species*
     _Section_: System::Species
     _Type_: block
     A specie is by definition either an "ion" (nucleus + core
     electrons) described  through a pseudo-potential, or an
     user-defined, model potential.

     Note that some common pseudopotentials are distributed with the
     code in the  directory _OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/_. To use these
     pseudopotentials you are  not required to define them explicitly
     in the Species block, as defaults  are provided by the program
     (you can override these defaults in any case).   Additional
     pseudopotentials can be downloaded from the  <a
     href='http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/pseudo.php'>octopus
     homepage</a>.

     The format of this block is the following: The first field is  the
     name of the specie, followed by the atomic mass (in atomic mass
     units). The third field defines the type of specie (the valid
     options  are detailed below), each type needs some extra
     parameters given in  the following fields of the row.

     In 3D, e.g.

     %Species
     'O'       | 15.9994 | spec_ps_tm2  | 8   | 1 | 1
     'H'       |  1.0079 | spec_ps_hgh  | 1   | 0 | 0
     'jlm'     | 23.2    | spec_jelli   | 8   | 5.0
     'pnt'     | 32.3    | spec_point   | 2.0
     'udf'     |  0.0    | user_defined | 8   | "1/2*r^2"
     'H_all'   |  1.0079 | spec_all_e   | 1
     %

     _Options_:
        - *spec_ps_tm2* (100):  Troullier Martins pseudopotential, the
          pseudopotential will be  read from an _.ascii_ or _.vps_
          file, either in the working  directory or in the
          _OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/TM2_ directory.   The following three
          numbers are the atomic number, the maximum  _l_-component of
          the pseudo-potential to consider in the  calculation, and the
          _l_-component to consider as local.

        - *spec_ps_hgh* (101):  Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter
          pseudopotentials, the next field is  the atomic number an the
          last two numbers are irrelevant, since they  do are not
          necessary to define the HGH pseudopotentials.

        - *user_defined* (123):  Specie with user defined potential. In
          this case, the fourth  field is the valence charge and the
          fifth  field is a string with a mathematical expression that
          defines the  potential (you can use any of the _x_, _y_, _z_
          or _r_ variables).

        - *spec_all_e* (124):  Atom represented with all electrons, the
          extra parameter is the  atomic number. WARNING 1: To
          correctly represent the atomic  potential, the atom will
          assumed to be on the closest grid point.   WARNING 2:
          Currently you can't use LCAO with this specie.

        - *spec_point* (2):  Point charge, the fourth field is the
          value of the charge.

        - *spec_jelli* (3):  Jellium sphere, the extra parameters are
          the charge of the jellium  sphere (an equal value of valence
          charge is assumed) and the radius of  the sphere.

6.8.3 Velocities
----------------

   * *RandomVelocityTemp*
     _Section_: System::Velocities
     _Type_: string
     If this variable is present, octopus will assign random velocities
     to the atoms  following a Bolzmann distribution with temperature
     given by RandomVelocityTemp.

   * *Velocities*
     _Section_: System::Velocities
     _Type_: block
     If XYZVelocities is not present, octopus will try to fetch the
     initial  atomic velocities from this block. If this block is not
     present, octopus  will reset the initial velocities to zero. The
     format of this block can be  illustrated by this example:

     %Velocities
     'C'  |      -1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
     'O'  |  1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
     %

     It describes one Carbon and one Oxygen moving at the relative
     velocity of 3.4, velocity units.

     Note: It is important for the velocities to maintain the ordering
     in which the species were defined in the coordinates
     specifications.

   * *XYZVelocities*
     _Section_: System::Velocities
     _Type_: string
     octopus will try to read the starting velocities of the atoms from
     the XYZ file  specified by the variable XYZVelocities.   Note that
     you do not need to specify initial velocities if you are not going
     to perform ion dynamics; if you are going to allow the ions to
     move but the velocities  are not specified, they are considered to
     be null.

6.9 Time Dependent
==================

   * *TDGauge*
     _Section_: Time Dependent
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: length
     In which gauge to treat the laser field.

     _Options_:
        - *length* (1):  Length gauge.

        - *velocity* (2):  Velocity gauge.

   * *TDLasers*
     _Section_: Time Dependent
     _Type_: block
     The block TDLasers describe the type and shape of time-dependent
     external perturbations  that are applied to the system.   Each
     line of the block describes a laser field; this way you can
     actually have more  than one laser (e.g. a "pump" and a "probe").
     The syntax of each line is, then:

     %TDLasers
     nx | ny | nz | amplitude | omega | envelope | tau0 | t0 | tau1 |
     filename1 | filename2
     %

     The first three (possibly complex) numbers mark the polarization
     direction of the  field. The "amplitude" is obviously the
     amplitude of the field. The "omega" is the  frequency. The
     "envelope" decides the shape of the enveloping function - see the
     manual for details. "tau0", "t0" and "tau1" are three paramenters
     that decide on the  temporal shape of the pulse - the exact
     details depend on the particular envelope.   Envelope: 0 -
     constant ("cw")            1 - Gaussian            2 - Cosinusoidal
     If the envelope is given in a file, this will be "filename1". If
     the spatial part  of the field is given in a file, this will be
     "filename2".

     The last three columns ("tau1", "filename1" and "filename2") are
     optional; they will  only be searched if needed.

     In order to give the spatial shape of the field in a file, the
     component "filename2"  has to be present. If it is not present,
     then the laser field will be a dipolar field  (which is the usual
     case).

--------------------------

   * *ABHeight*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Absorbing Boundaries
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: -0.2 a.u.
     When AbsorbingBoundaries == sin2, is the height of the imaginary
     potential.

   * *ABWidth*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Absorbing Boundaries
     _Type_: float

     Width of the region used to apply the absorbing boundaries.

   * *AbsorbingBoundaries*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Absorbing Boundaries
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: no_absorbing
     To improve the quality of the spectra by avoiding the formation of
     standing density waves, one can make the boundaries of the
     simulation  box absorbing.

     _Options_:
        - *no_absorbing*:  No absorbing boundaries.

        - *sin2* (1):  A \sin^2 imaginary potential is added at the
          boundaries.

          boundaries.

6.9.2 Linear Response
---------------------

   * *TDDeltaStrength*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Linear Response
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: 0.0
     When no laser is applied, a delta (in time) electric field with
     strength TDDeltaStrength is applied. This is used to calculate
     the linear optical spectra.

   * *TDDeltaStrengthMode*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Linear Response
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: kick_density
     When calculating the linear response of the density via the
     propagation  in real time, one needs to perfrom an initical kick
     on the KS system, at  time zero. Depending on what kind response
     property one wants to obtain,  this kick may be done in several
     modes.

     _Options_:
        - *kick_density*:  The total density of the system is perturbed.

        - *kick_spin* (1):  The individual spin densities are perturbed
          differently. Note that this mode  is only possible if the run
          is done in spin polarized mode, or with spinors.

        - *kick_spin_and_density* (2):  A combination of the two above.
          Note that this mode  is only possible if the run is done in
          spin polarized mode, or with spinors.

   * *TDPolarization*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Linear Response
     _Type_: block
     The (real) polarization of the delta electric field. Normally  one
     needs three perpendicular polarization directions to calculate a
     spectrum (unless symmetry is used).   The format of the block is:

     %TDPolarization
     pol1x | pol1y | pol1z
     pol2x | pol2y | pol2z
     pol3x | pol3y | pol3z
     %

     Octopus uses both this block and the variable
     TDPolarizationDirection  to determine the polarization vevtor for
     the run. For example, if TDPolarizationDirection=2  the
     polarization (pol2x, pol2y, pol2z) would be used.

     The default value for TDPolarization are the three Cartesian unit
     vectors  (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).

   * *TDPolarizationDirection*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Linear Response
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: 1
     Defines which one of the lines of TDPolarization to use for  the
     run. In a typical run (without using the symmetry), TDPolarization
     would contain the three Cartesian unit vectors, and one would
     make 3 runs  varying TDPolarization from 1 to 3.

6.9.4 Propagation
-----------------

   * *MoveIons*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: static_ions
     What kind of simulation to perform.

     _Options_:
        - *static_ions*:  Do not move the ions.

        - *verlet* (3):  Newtonian dynamics using Verlet.

        - *vel_verlet* (4):  Newtonian dynamics using velocity Verlet.

   * *RecalculateGSDuringEvolution*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: logical
     _Default_: no
     In order to calculate some information about the system along the
     evolution (e.g. projection onto the ground-state KS determinant,
     projection of the TDKS spin-orbitals onto the grond-state KS
     spin-orbitals), the ground-state KS orbitals are needed. If the
     ionic potential changes - that is, the ions move -, one may want
     to recalculate the ground state. You may do this by setting this
     variable.

     The recalculation is not done every time step, but only every
     OutputEvery time steps.

   * *TDEvolutionMethod*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: etrs
     This variable determines which algorithm will be used to
     approximate  the evolution operator U(t+\delta t, t). That is,
     known  \psi(\tau) and H(\tau) for tau \le t,  calculate t+\delta
     t. Note that in general the Hamiltonian  is not known at times in
     the interior of the interval [t,t+\delta t].   This is due to the
     self-consistent nature of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham problem:
     the Hamiltonian at a given time \tau is built from the  "solution"
     wavefunctions at that time.

     Some methods, however, do require the knowledge of the Hamiltonian
     at some  point of the interval [t,t+\delta t]. This problem is
     solved by making  use of extrapolation: given a number l of time
     steps previous to time  t, this information is used to build the
     Hamiltonian at arbitrary times  within [t,t+\delta t]. To be fully
     precise, one should then proceed  _self-consistently_: the
     obtained Hamiltonian at time t+\delta t  may then be used to
     interpolate the Hamiltonian, and repeat the evolution  algorithm
     with this new information. Whenever iterating the procedure does
     not change the solution wave-functions, the cycle is stopped. In
     practice,  in octopus we perform a second-order extrapolation
     without  self-consistente check, except for the first two
     iterations, where obviously  the extrapolation is not reliable.

     The proliferation of methods is certainly excessive; The reason
     for it is that  the propagation algorithm is currently a topic of
     active development. We  hope that in the future the optimal
     schemes are clearly identified. In the  mean time, if you do not
     feel like testing, use the default choices and  make sure the time
     step is small enough.

     _Options_:
        - *split*:  Split Operator (SO).   This is one of the most
          traditional methods. It splits the full Hamiltonian  into a
          kinetic and a potential part, performing the first in
          Fourier-space,  and the latter in real space. The necessary
          transformations are performed  with the FFT algorithm.



          Since those three exponentials may be calculated exactly, one
          does not  need to use any of the methods specified by
          variable TDExponentialMethod  to perform them.

          The key point is the specification of V^*. Let V(t) be
          divided into  V_\rm int(t), the "internal" potential which
          depends self-consistently  on the density, and V_\rm ext(t),
          the external potential that we know  at all times since it is
          imposed to the system by us (e.g. a laser field):  V(t)=V_\rm
          int(t)+V_\rm ext(t). Then we define to be V^* to  be the sum
          of V_\rm ext(t+\delta t/2) and the internal potential built
          from the wavefunctions _after_ applying the right-most
          kinetic term  of the equation, \exp \lbrace -i\delta t/2 T
          \rbrace.

          It may the be demonstrated that the order of the error of the
          algorithm is the  same that the one that we would have by
          making use of the Exponential Midpoint Rule  (EM, described
          below), the SO algorithm to calculate the action of the
          exponential of the Hamiltonian, and a full self-consistent
          procedure.

        - *suzuki_trotter* (1):  This is the generalization of the
          Suzuki-Trotter algorithm, described  as one of the choices of
          the TDExponentialMethod,  to time-dependent problem. Consult
          the paper by O. Sugino and M. Miyamoto,  Phys. Rev. B *59*,
          2579 (1999), for details.

          It requires of Hamiltonian extrapolations.

        - *etrs* (2):  The idea is to make use of the time-reversal
          symmetry from the beginning:



          and then invert to obtain:



          But we need to know H_n+1, which can only be known exactly
          through the solution  \psi_n+1. What we do is to estimate it
          by performing a single exponential:  \psi^*_n+1=\exp \left(
          -i\delta t H_n \right) \psi_n, and then  H_n+1 =
          H[\psi^*_n+1]. Thus no extrapolation is performed in this
          case.

        - *aetrs* (3):  Approximated Enforced Time-Reversal Symmetry
          (AETRS).   A modification of previous method to make it
          faster.   It is based on extrapolation of the time-dependent
          potentials. It is faster  by about 40%.

          The only difference is the procedure to estimate H_n+1: in
          this case  it is extrapolated trough a second-order
          polynomial by making use of the  Hamiltonian at time
          t-2\delta t, t-\delta t and t.

        - *exp_mid* (4):  Exponential Midpoint Rule (EM).   This is
          maybe the simplest method, but is is very well grounded
          theretically:  it is unitary (if the exponential is performed
          correctly) and preserves  time symmetry (if the
          self-consistency problem is dealt with correctly).   It is
          defined as:



        - *magnus* (5):  Magnus Expansion (M4).   This is the most
          sophisticated approach. It is a fourth order scheme (feature
          that shares with the ST scheme; the other schemes are in
          principle second order).   It is tailored for making use of
          very large time steps, or equivalently,  dealing with problem
          with very high-frequency time dependence.   It is still in a
          experimental state; we are not yet sure of when it is
          advantageous.

   * *TDExpOrder*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: 4
     For TDExponentialMethod equal standard or chebyshev, the order to
     which  the exponential is expanded. For the Lanczos approximation,
     it is the maximum  Lanczos-subspace dimension.

   * *TDExponentialMethod*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: standard
     Method used to numerically calculate the exponential of the
     Hamiltonian,  a core part of the full algorithm used to
     approximate the evolution  operator, specified through the
     variable TDEvolutionMethod.   In the case of using the Magnus
     method, described below, the action of the exponential  of the
     Magnus operator is also calculated through the algorithm specified
     by this variable.

     _Options_:
        - *split*:  It is important to distinguish between applying the
          split operator method  to calculate the exponential of the
          Hamiltonian at a given time - which  is what this variable is
          referring to - from the split operator method  as an
          algorithm to approximate the full evolution operator
          U(t+\delta t, t),  and which will be described below as one
          of the possibilities  of the variable TDEvolutionMethod.
          The equation that describes the split operator scheme is well
          known:


          \exp_@{\rm SO@} (-i \delta t H) = \exp (-i \delta t/2 V) \exp (-i \delta t T) \exp (-i \delta t/2 V).

          Note that this is a "kinetic referenced SO", since the
          kinetic term is sandwiched in the  middle. This is so because
          in octopus, the states spend most of its time in real-space;
          doing  it "potential referenced" would imply 4 FFTs instead
          of 2.   This split-operator technique may be used in
          combination with, for example,  the exponential midpoint rule
          as a means to approximate the evolution operator.   In that
          case, the potential operator _V_ that appears in the equation
          would be  calculated at time t+\delta t/2, that is, in the
          middle of the time-step.   However, note that if the
          split-operator method is invoked as a means to approximate
          the evolution operator (TDEvolutionMethod = 0), a different
          procedure is taken - it  will be described below -, and in
          fact the variable TDExponentialMethod has no  effect at all.

        - *suzuki_trotter* (1):  This is a higher-order SO based
          algorithm. See O. Sugino and Y. Miyamoto,  Phys. Rev. B *59*,
          2579 (1999). Allows for larger time-steps,  but requires five
          times more time than the normal SO.

          The considerations made above for the SO algorithm about the
          distinction  between using the method as a means to
          approximate U(t+\delta t) or as a  means to approximate the
          exponential also apply here. Setting TDEvolutionMethod = 1
          enforces the use of the ST as an algorithm to approximate the
          full evolution operator,  which is slightly different (see
          below).

        - *lanczos* (2):  Allows for larger time-steps.   However, the
          larger the time-step, the longer the computational time per
          time-step.   In certain cases, if the time-step is too large,
          the code will emit a warning  whenever it considers that the
          evolution may not be properly proceeding -  the Lanczos
          process did not converge. The method consists in a Krylov
          subspace approximation of the action of the exponential  (see
          M. Hochbruck and C. Lubich, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. *34*, 1911
          (1997) for details).   Two more variables control the
          performance of the method: the maximum dimension  of this
          subspace (controlled by variable TDExpOrder), and  the
          stopping criterium (controlled by variable TDLanczosTol).
          The smaller the stopping criterium, the more precisely the
          exponential  is calculated, but also the larger the dimension
          of the Arnoldi  subspace. If the maximum dimension allowed by
          TDExpOrder is not  enough to meet the criterium, the
          above-mentioned warning is emitted.

        - *standard* (3):  This method amounts to a straightforward
          application of the definition of  the exponential of an
          operator, in terms of it Taylor expansion.


          \exp_@{\rm STD@} (-i\delta t H) = \sum_@{i=0@}^@{k@} @{(-i\delta t)^i\over@{i!@}@} H^i.

          The order _k_ is determined by variable _TDExpOder_.   Some
          numerical considerations (by Jeff Giansiracusa and George F.
          Bertsch;  see http://www.phys.washington.edu/~bertsch/num3.ps)
          suggest the 4th order as especially suitable and stable.

        - *chebyshev* (4):  In principle, the Chebyshev expansion  of
          the exponential represents it more accurately than the
          canonical or standard expansion.   As in the latter case,
          TDExpOrder determines the order of the expansion.

          There exists a closed analytical form for the coefficients of
          the exponential in terms  of Chebyshev polynomials:


          \exp_@{\rm CHEB@} \left( -i\delta t H \right) = \sum_@{k=0@}^@{\infty@} (2-\delta_@{k0@})(-i)^@{k@}J_k(\delta t) T_k(H),

          where J_k are the Bessel functions of the first kind, and H
          has te be previously  scaled to [-1,1].   See H. Tal-Ezer and
          R. Kosloff, J. Chem. Phys. *81*,  3967 (1984); R. Kosloff,
          Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. *45*, 145 (1994);  C. W. Clenshaw,
          MTAC *9*, 118 (1955).

   * *TDLanczosTol*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: float
     _Default_: 1e-5
     An internal tolerance variable for the Lanczos method. The
     smaller, the more  precisely the exponential is calculated, and
     also the bigger the dimension  of the Krylov subspace needed to
     perform the algorithm. One should carefully  make sure that this
     value is not too big, or else the evolution will be  wrong.

   * *TDMaximumIter*
     _Section_: Time Dependent::Propagation
     _Type_: integer
     _Default_: 1500
     Number of time steps in which the total integration time is
     divided;  in previous notation, _N_.

8 External utilities
********************

A few small programs are generated along with `octopus', for the
purpose of post-processing the generated information. These utilities
should all be run from the directory where `octopus' was run, so that
it may see the input file, and the directories created by it.

8.1 `oct-sf'
============

This utility generates the dipole strength function of the given system.
Its main input is the `td.general/multipoles' file. Output is written
to a file called `spectrum'. This file is made of two columns: energy
(in eV or a.u., depending on the units specified in the input file),
and dipole strength function (in 1/eV, or 1/a.u., idem).

   In the input file, the user may set the `SpecTransformMode' - this
should be set to "sin" for proper use -, the `SpecDampMode' -
recommended value is "pol", which ensures fulfilling of the N-sum rule,
the `SpecStartTime', the `SpecEndTime', the `SpecEnergyStep', the
`SpecMinEnergy' and the `SpecMaxEnergy'.

================

Calculates the excitation spectrum within linear response. This utility
can output just the difference of eigenvalues by setting
`LinEigenvalues', the excitations using M. Petersilka formula
(`LinPetersilka'), or M. Casida (`LinCasida'). This utility requires
that a calculation of unoccupied states (`CalculationMode' = unocc) has
been done before, and it outputs the results to the sub-directory
"linear". The states entering the calculation can be chosen with the
variable `ExciteStates'.

8.7 `oct-broad'

`oct-excite' utility. The parameters of the spectrum can be set using
the variables `LinBroadening', `LinMinEnergy', `LinMaxEnergy', and

8.8 `oct-make-st'
=================

`make_st' reads `tmp/restart.static' and replaces some of the Kohn-Sham
states by Gaussians wave packets. The states which should be replaced
are given in the `%MakeStates' section in the input file and written to
`tmp/restart.static.new'. (You probably want to copy that file to
`tmp/restart.static' and use then `CalculationMode=5' or `6'.)

     %MakeStates
       ik | ist | idim | type | sigma | x0 | k
     %

   The first values stand for

   * ik: The k point (or the spin, if `spin-components=2') of the state

   * ist: The state to be replaced

   * idim: The component of the state (if the wave functions have more
     than one component, i.e. when `spin-components=3' is used).

   * The type of the wave packet; currently only `1' (Gaussian) is
     available

   The next items depend on the type chosen.  For a Gaussian wave
packet, defined as

   psi(x) = 1/sigma sqrt(1/2pi) exp(ik(x-x0)) exp(-(x-x0)^2/(2
sigma^2)),

   they are:

   * \sigma the width of the Gaussian

   * k: the *k* vector. In 3D use `k1|k2|k3'.

   * x_0: the coordinate where the Gaussian is initially centred. In 3D
     use `x01|x02|x03'.

block, or by the `XYZCoordinates' or `PDBCoordinates' variables), and
outputs the adjusted coordinates to the file `adjusted.xyz'. The
following parameters are read from the `inp'ut file:

   * `MainAxis' (block data): A vector of three reals defining the axis
     to which the molecule should be align. If not present, the default
     value will be
              %MainAxis
                1 | 0 | 1
              %

   * `AxisType' (int, inertia): This variable describes how to
     calculate the "main" axis of the molecule. Possible values are:
        - `inertia' or `1': Axis of inertia;

        - `pseudo'  or `2': Axis of inertia calculated as if all atoms
          had mass 1;

        - `large'   or `2': The longest axis of the molecule.

8.10 `wf.net'
=============

This is an OpenDX network, aimed at the visualization of wave-functions.
To be able to use it, you need to have properly installed the OpenDX
program (get it at opendx.org), as well as the Chemistry extensions
obtainable at the Cornell Theory Center
(http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Services/Vis/dx/index.asp).  Once these are
working, you may follow a small tutorial on `wf.net' by following next
steps:

   o Place in a directory the program wf.net, the (needed) auxiliary
     file wf.cfg, and the sample inp file that can all be found in
     `OCTOPUS-HOME'/util.

   o Run `octopus'. The inp file used prescribes the calculation of the
     C atom in its ground state, in spin-polarized mode. It also
     prescribes that the wave-functions should be written in "dx"
     format. At the end, these should be written in subdirectory
     "static": wf-00x-00y-1.dx, where x runs from 1 to 2 (spin quantum
     number) and y runs from 1 to 4 (wave-function index).

   o Run the OpenDX program. Click on "Run Visual Programs" on the DX
     main menu, and select the program `wf.net'. The program will be
     executed, and several windows should open. One of them should be
     called "Application Comment". It contains a small tutorial. Follow
     it from now on.

9.0.1 Hello world
-----------------

As a first example, we will take a sodium atom.  With your favourite
text editor, create the following input "inp".
       SystemName = 'Na'
       CalculationMode = 1
       %Species
         'Na' | 22.989768 | 11 | "tm2" | 0 | 0
       %
       %Coordinates
         'Na' | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
       %
       Radius = 12.0
       Spacing = .6
       TypeOfMixing = 2

   This input file should be essentially self-explanatory.  Note that a
Troullier-Martins pseudopotential file ("Na.vps", or "Na.ascii") should
be accesible to the program. A sample "Na.ascii" may be found in
`OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/TM2'. If `octopus' was installed (`make install'
was issued after `make'), there should be no need to do anything - the
program should find it. Otherwise, you may as well place it in the
working directory.  Then run `octopus' - for example, do `octopus > out
', so that the output is stored in "out" file. If everything goes OK,
"out" should look like (1):

   Take now a look at the working directory. It should include the
following files:
     -rw-rw-r--    1 user  group       177 Jul 10 12:29 inp
     -rw-rw-r--    1 user  group      4186 Jul 10 12:35 out
     -rw-rw-r--    1 user  group      1626 Jul 10 12:35 out.oct
     drwxrwxr-x    2 user  group      4096 Jul 10 12:35 static
     drwxrwxr-x    2 user  group      4096 Jul 10 12:35 tmp

   Besides the initial file (`inp') and the `out' file, two new
directories appear. In `static', you will find the file `info', with
information about the static calculation (it should be hopefully
self-explanatory, otherwise please complain to the authors).  In `tmp',
you will find the `restart.static', a binary file containg restart
information about the ground-state, which is used if, for example, you
want to start a time-dependent calculation afterwards.  Finally, you
can safely ignore `out.oct': it is an output from the liboct library,
irrelevant for what concerns physics ;).

   *Exercises*:
   * Study how the total energy and eigenvalue of the sodium atom
     improve   with the mesh spacing.

   * Calculate the static polarizability of the sodium atom
     (`CalculationMode = 7').    Two new files will be generated:
     `restart.pol' that can be used to resume   the polarizability
     calculation, and `Na.pol' that contains the static polarizability
     tensor. Note that this calculation overwrites
     `tmp/restart.static', so that   what now is there is the ground
     state for the system _with_ an external static   electrical field
     applied. Delete it since it is useless.

   * Calculate a few unoccupied states (`CalculationMode = 3'). The
     eigenspectrum   will be in the file `eigenvalues'. Why don't we
     find a Rydberg series in the   eigenspectrum?

   * Repeat the previous calculation with PBE, LB94, and exact exchange.
      Don't forget to *move* the file `tmp/restart.static' when
     switching   between exchange-correlation functionals.

   * Perform a time-dependent evolution (`CalculationMode = 5'), to
     calculate   the optical spectrum of the Na atom. Use a
     `TDDeltaStrength = 0.05', polarised   in the `x' direction. The
     multipole moments of the density are output to   the file
     `td.general/multipoles'. You can process this file with the utility
      `strength-function' to obtain the optical spectrum.    If you
     have computer time to waste, re-run the time-dependent
     simulation for some other xc choices.

9.0.2 Benzene
-------------

Well, the sodium atom is a bit too trivial. Let's try something harder:
benzene.  you will just need the geometry for benzene to be able to
play. Here it is (in AA):
      C  0.000  1.396  0.000
      C  1.209  0.698  0.000
      C  1.209 -0.698  0.000
      C  0.000 -1.396  0.000
      C -1.209 -0.698  0.000
      C -1.209  0.698  0.000
      H  0.000  2.479  0.000
      H  2.147  1.240  0.000
      H  2.147 -1.240  0.000
      H  0.000 -2.479  0.000
      H -2.147 -1.240  0.000
      H -2.147  1.240  0.000

   Follow now the steps of the previous example. Carbon and Hydrogen
have a much harder pseudo-potential than Sodium, so you will probably
have to use a tighter mesh. It also takes much more time...
