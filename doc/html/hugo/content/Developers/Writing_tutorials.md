### About this web page

The {{< Octopus >}} documentation web pages use [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as framework with the [hugo-theme-learn](https://learn.netlify.app/en/) theme.
Hugo is a static webpage generator, which builds web pages from markdown sources.

For the {{< Octopus >}} pages, we keep these markdown sources within the {{< Octopus >}} source repository, which should encourage to write documentation whenever new code is added, and to update the documentation in case of code changes. The remaining files (e.g. configuration, shortcodes), required for the hugo system reside in a separate [repository]().



### Hugo shortcodes

Hugo provides so-called [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/), which allow to define functions or macros, which can be used on a markdown page.
