Title: "Time propagation"
Weight: 1
---

In the new multisystem framework, the time propagation is handled by the routine {{< code "time_dependent_run_multisystem()" >}}

{{% expand "Expand for the source" %}}
```Fortran
#include_subroutine time_dependent_run_multisystem
```
{{% /expand %}}

The code is quite self-explanatory.
