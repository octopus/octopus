Clocks are essential to keep things synchronized. This is also the case in {{<octopus>}}, where instances of the {{< code clock_t >}} type are used to ensure that different systems stay in sync during time propagation. Clocks are used to determine whether quantities or interactions need to be updated in a propagation step.

The smallest unit of time in {{< octopus >}} is one {{< code tick >}}.
