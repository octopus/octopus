# ----- Time step variables ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Time step of the propagation
# In case of coupled Maxwell-Kohn Sham propagation, this variable is the matter timestep.
# The Maxwell system time step is given by TDTimeStep/MaxwellTDIntervalSteps
# so that the Maxwell system propagates several intermediate steps between consecutive matter steps.
#
# TDTimeStep should be equal or smaller than the Courant criterion, which is here
# S_Courant = 1 / (sqrt(c^2/dx_mx^2 + c^2/dx_mx^2 + c^2/dx_mx^2))

TDTimeStep = 0.002

# Total number of Matter steps to run
TDMaxSteps = 200

# Maxwell intermediate time steps only plays a role in the maxwell_ks mode. It
# indicates the number of Maxwell time propagations between consecutive matter steps
MaxwellTDIntervalSteps = 1

# The Maxwell TD relaxation steps are the number of steps in the maxwell_ks mode,
# where the run propagates only in a standard TD mode to relax the starting
# groundstate if necessary.

TDMaxwellTDRelaxationSteps = 0

# The Maxwell ks relaxation steps denote the number of steps in the maxwell_ks mode,
# where the run propagates in a maxwell_ks mode without any external field to relax
# the starting groundstate if necessary.

TDMaxwellKSRelaxationSteps = 0

# Approximation method for the Maxwell ETRS propagator
# MaxwellTDETRSApprox = no (no approximation)
# MaxwellTDETRSApprox = const_steps (assumption that the current density is approximately constant
# between two matter time steps and using the arithmetic mean of the current density at the latest # matter time step and the next matter time step)
MaxwellTDETRSApprox = no

# Internal current test run, the test function is hard coded in current.F90
CurrentPropagationTest = no
