 # ------- Matter output variables (see https://octopus-code.org/doc/9.1/html/vars.php) ---------

# Matter output variables 
# - Output = potential
# - Output = wfs (matter wavefunctions)
# - Output = geometry (positions of the ions)
# - Output = density (matter electronic density)
# - Output = current (matter current density)
# - Output = ELF (electron localization function)
# - Output = forces (forces acting on the ions)

Output = potential + density + current + geometry + forces + elf

# Output interval steps for the matter variables. After OutputInterval steps, the
# matter variables on the grid are written into the output_iter folder
OutputInterval = 1

# Output of the scalar matter variables for each time step, written into the td.general folder
TDOutput = energy + multipoles + laser + geometry
