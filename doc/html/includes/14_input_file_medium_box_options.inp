# ----- Medium Box ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Medium box parameters like size, epsilon, mu, electric loss and magnetic loss
# Column 1: Length of the box in x-direction
# Column 2: Length of the box in y-direction
# Column 3: Length of the box in z-direction
# Column 4: Center coordinate of the box in x-direction
# Column 5: Center coordinate of the box in y-direction
# Column 6: Center coordinate of the box in z-direction
# Column 7: Electric permittivity factor (epsilon_r)
# Column 8: Magnetic permeability factor (mu_r)
# Column 9: Electric loss (sigma_e)
# Column 10: Magnetic loss (sigma_m)
# Column 11: Edge option ("edged" for sharp edges, "smooth" for using a smoothing function)
