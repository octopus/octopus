	* [r9805] Missing build dependency.

2013-01-05 13:51  xavier

	* [r9806] Removed useless return statments from the json code.

2013-01-05 13:58  xavier

	* [r9807] More cleaning of the json module.

2013-01-05 14:41  xavier

	* [r9808] The json code is causing problems with the Blue Gene/Q,
	  so I disabled the json output of the geometry. This should not be
	  a problem since this output is not used.

2013-01-06 10:54  xavier

	* [r9809] Removed PUSH_SUB/POP_SUB from a subroutine and declared
	  it pure to avoid recursive I/O.

2013-01-06 11:10  xavier

	* [r9810] Some integer values were initialized using M_ZERO.

2013-01-06 12:11  xavier

	* [r9811] Declared pure and removed PUSH_SUB/POP_SUB from two
	  functions that are called from an I/O statement.

2013-01-06 12:22  xavier

	* [r9812] * More fixes about recursive I/O.
	  * Fixed a FLOAT literal declaration.

2013-01-06 15:00  xavier

	* [r9813] Increased the tolerance for the Fortran derivatives
	  tests, as it appears
	  that this implementation is more compiler dependent that the C
	  version.

2013-01-07 15:19  xavier

	* [r9814] A reduction of size 0 caused a problem on the Blue Gene
	  Q.

2013-01-07 15:58  xavier

	* [r9815] Added a check for size 0 in reductions of dimension 2.

2013-01-07 18:11  xavier

	* [r9816] A fix to my last commit. An optional value was used, even
	  when not present.

2013-01-11 09:44  joseba

	* [r9817] Updated the label of the PFFT plans to be properly
	  printed.

2013-01-14 19:25  dstrubbe

	* [r9818] * Typos.
	  * Putting warning about 1D and 2D ion-ion interaction in variable
	  reference too.

2013-01-14 20:49  dstrubbe

	* [r9819] Added directory names to TestGroups for each test, as
	  suggested by Carlo.

2013-01-14 22:16  dstrubbe

	* [r9820] * Removed 'oct' test group, now superseded by
	  'optimal_control'.
	  * Updated TestGroups file.

2013-01-14 23:56  dstrubbe

	* [r9821] * Error message if no coordinates are given in input.
	  * Clarification to documentation.

2013-01-15 02:51  dstrubbe

	* [r9822] Clarification and separation lines.

2013-01-15 09:27  joseba

	* [r9823] * Added the possibility to disable the execution of the
	  partition, since it is used only with the only purpose of
	  printing information. The importance of this changes comes from
	  the fact that computing this part in big systems with large
	  number of processes takes longer and longer (even hours),
	  consuming almost useless core-hours.
	  * Added the possibility to disable the execution of symmetries
	  calculation
	  * Some line breaks

2013-01-15 12:43  marques

	* [r9824] Let's see if this corrects the bug with B97-like
	  functionals

2013-01-15 12:47  marques

	* [r9825] Added interface as noted by Fabien Tran.

2013-01-15 13:56  marques

	* [r9827] The same kind of bug was also present in TPSS.

2013-01-15 15:03  marques

	* [r9828] And again the same error in vsxc

2013-01-15 19:31  dstrubbe

	* [r9829] Improvements to r9823: 'SymmetriesCompute' disables all
	  symmetry calculations, not just for finite systems, and does
	  leave proper initialization to identity. Also, fixed typo and
	  unnecessarily added variables.

2013-01-16 09:47  marques

	* [r9831] Still another POLARIZED missing in a functional that uses
	  the stoll decomposition.

2013-01-16 13:42  marques

	* [r9832] Added new metagga functionals: X_MS0, X_MS1, X_MS2, and
	  X_MS2H (a hybrid version of MS2)

2013-01-16 20:37  dstrubbe

	* [r9833] Improvements to Poisson solver info, including reference
	  to recent arXiV paper.

2013-01-16 21:12  dstrubbe

	* [r9834] Clarifications to documentation and output regarding
	  Poisson solvers.

2013-01-17 21:26  dstrubbe

	* [r9835] Reducing verbosity of warnings by making only one comment
	  about Lsize or Spacing not matching the recommended value if they
	  were specified as one value rather than separately for each
	  direction in the input file.

2013-01-17 21:49  dstrubbe

	* [r9836] * Small bugfix: condition for warning about Smearing
	  needing ExtraStates was mistaken for spin-polarized calculations.
	  * Message when disabling symmetries for user-defined species now
	  says only that non-spherically symmetric species "may" be
	  present, rather than definitely are present, since we are not
	  actually analyzing that.

2013-01-17 23:19  dstrubbe

	* [r9837] * Corrected misplaced PUSH_SUB.
	  * Warning about no XSF except in 3D now states which function it
	  is talking about.

2013-01-18 00:06  dstrubbe

	* [r9838] * For 2D systems periodic in 2D, the default Poisson FFT
	  kernel was set to be the planar one, but that was not even
	  considered a possibility in later code, leading to an assertion
	  failure and/or nonsensical results. Now the default is fft_nocut,
	  which seems to have been the intention from the rest of the code.
	  * The default for PoissonFFTKernel are enumerated in the
	  documentation.
	  * Removed attempts at HTML formatting in output.

2013-01-18 08:59  marques

	* [r9839] Small bug fixes. Micael can you check if any of the
	  segfaults disapears?

2013-01-18 18:46  dstrubbe

	* [r9841] Removed keyword 'OnlyUserDef' from input files which does
	  not exist, and is presumably obsolete.

2013-01-18 21:52  dstrubbe

	* [r9842] Added tests for total energy components in sodium chain
	  test. I am surprised that we get a negative number for the
	  Hartree energy here.

2013-01-18 21:59  dstrubbe

	* [r9843] Fix of uninitialized use of 'idir' as flagged by
	  valgrind.

2013-01-18 22:08  dstrubbe

	* [r9844] svn:ignore for new file 'test-driver'

2013-01-19 05:37  dstrubbe

	* [r9845] More specific and helpful error messages when an
	  incompatible Poisson solver is chosen.

2013-01-19 05:41  dstrubbe

	* [r9846] Removed variable DELTA_R in favor of M_EPSILON which is
	  our standard tolerance for floating-point comparisons.

2013-01-19 20:25  dstrubbe

	* [r9847] Restored if-condition accidentally removed in r9845,
	  which broke a lot of tests.

2013-01-19 20:55  dstrubbe

	* [r9848] * Direct3D Poisson solver (at least in serial case) was
	  only working for curvilinear coordinates. Now it works for
	  regular grids too.
	  * Added a test for this solver.

2013-01-19 22:15  dstrubbe

	* [r9849] * The serial version of the direct3D Poisson solver was
	  mistakenly using a prefactor copied from the 2D case. Also, the
	  parallel case used two subtly different values for no good
	  reason. Now the same prefactor is always used.
	  * This improves slightly the accuracy of the integration in the
	  test.

2013-01-19 22:40  dstrubbe

	* [r9850] Documenting a secret variable and specifying when it
	  applies.

2013-01-19 23:01  dstrubbe

	* [r9851] Consolidated useless repeated code in select statement.

2013-01-19 23:10  dstrubbe

	* [r9852] Consolidated options for direct-sum Poisson solver into
	  one, rather than separately for each dimension. It is better to
	  select automatically the correct dimensionality than to just
	  complain or give a wrong answer if a different dimensionality was
	  selected.

2013-01-19 23:22  dstrubbe

	* [r9853] Removed useless routine zpoisson1D_solve for complex
	  scaling: it adds unnecessary complexity and computational
	  expense, compared to the approach used for the other solvers.

2013-01-19 23:28  dstrubbe

	* [r9854] Now the direct Poisson solver actually tries to work in
	  curvilinear mode, as claimed by the code elsewhere.

2013-01-19 23:48  dstrubbe

	* [r9855] Updating name in testsuite file.

2013-01-20 00:01  dstrubbe

	* [r9856] * In 3D direct solver, simplified code in parallel branch
	  with volume_element and vol_pp, and in serial branch, removed
	  unstated assumption that the spacing is identical in all
	  directions. (At this point, I think that this solver existing
	  only for "testing" is actually correct...)
	  * Began generalizing to arbitrary number of dimensions.

2013-01-20 00:04  dstrubbe

	* [r9857] Removed explicit reference to 3D and useless variable xg.

2013-01-20 00:12  dstrubbe

	* [r9858] The 2D direct Poisson solver is decommissioned in favor
	  of a general 2D/3D one. This corrects several problems with the
	  2D one which I recently fixed in the 3D one.

2013-01-20 00:35  dstrubbe

	* [r9859] Removing 2D direct solver since the general 2D/3D one is
	  now used.

2013-01-20 00:40  dstrubbe

	* [r9860] Fixing exponent on volume which is 1/3 in 3D but 1/2 in
	  2D. Moving to prefactor when not curvilinear to help performance.

2013-01-20 00:49  dstrubbe

	* [r9861] It is better not to have so many if's in the inner do
	  loop.

2013-01-20 01:04  dstrubbe

	* [r9862] Removed unneeded PoissonSolver lines in input files that
	  have TheoryLevel = independent_particles.

2013-01-20 01:09  dstrubbe

	* [r9863] Fixing syntax errors.

2013-01-20 03:25  dstrubbe

	* [r9864] Allowing compilation with BerkeleyGW and
	  --with-max-dim=4.

2013-01-20 03:30  dstrubbe

	* [r9865] Explicit bounds to avoid an issue with max dim = 4 on
	  lascar. Also, a 3 was accidentally left in one place that would
	  cause trouble for 2D direct sum Poisson.

2013-01-20 03:43  dstrubbe

	* [r9866] intel doesn't seem to like my syntax. Bringing back the
	  temporary variable 'xg'.

2013-01-20 04:27  dstrubbe

	* [r9867] * Documenting secret variable PoissonCutoffRadius. I am
	  not sure why you would wish to adjust this though.
	  * Some combinations of dimensionality did not parse the variable
	  or write output, now they all do the same thing.
	  * The default, and condition for warning, should be based only on
	  finite directions, not on periodic directions -- in the case that
	  a periodic direction was larger than a finite direction (unusual
	  but certainly possible), I think you would get the wrong answer.

2013-01-21 10:11  marques

	* [r9868] No more NaNs in optc ;)

2013-01-21 10:23  marques

	* [r9869] No more NaN in gga_c_wl

2013-01-21 12:29  marques

	* [r9870] This fixes the NaNs that were appearing on the HJS_B88
	  functional

2013-01-21 12:34  marques

	* [r9871] Fixed NaNs in the TPSS and PKZB

2013-01-21 14:40  micael

	* [r9872] * Some NaN were still appearing.

2013-01-21 16:37  micael

	* [r9874] * Tagging Libxc version 2.0.1.

2013-01-22 12:25  marques

	* [r9875] Added interfaces to get/set hybrid and cam parameters

2013-01-22 13:15  marques

	* [r9876] Added the variant PBE (vPBE) functional. From my tests
	  this is virtually identical to the PBE.

2013-01-22 13:20  marques

	* [r9877] Reset of the testsuite after all the bug corrections

2013-01-22 13:28  mjv500

	* [r9878] bug in normalization of propag spectrum, for non kick
	  case - this has been patched before...

2013-01-22 13:40  marques

	* [r9879] Added revisedTPSS correlation

2013-01-23 09:23  marques

	* [r9880] Corrected reference. Thanks David.

2013-01-23 09:52  marques

	* [r9881] Removed interface to _set_cam and _set_exx.
	  Added interface to set mixing of both pbe0 and hse

2013-01-23 11:52  marques

	* [r9882] Changed the name of a variable and a comment. Thanks
	  Fabien.

2013-01-24 10:39  joseba

	* [r9883] Corrections in the explanations of Hamiltonian/Poisson
	  input variables
	  Deleted unused input variables
	  
	  Changes by Pablo Garcia Risueño

2013-01-24 14:41  joseba

	* [r9884] Removed useless white spaces
	  Added few doxygen comments

2013-01-24 14:49  joseba

	* [r9885] More useless white spaces

2013-01-24 17:14  dstrubbe

	* [r9886] Little cleanups of documentation.

2013-01-24 17:34  joseba

	* [r9887] Adapted the configuration to the new library of LIBFM
	  included in the general ScaFaCos.
	  Cleaning of variables in the code.

2013-01-24 17:39  joseba

	* [r9888] Updated my name in the (c)

2013-01-24 20:04  dstrubbe

	* [r9889] References.

2013-01-25 17:35  dstrubbe

	* [r9890] Making a routine name more specific.

2013-01-25 18:24  dstrubbe

	* [r9891] Blocking multipole corrections for Poisson in periodic
	  systems.

2013-01-27 12:24  xavier

	* [r9892] Missing call to opencl_finish.

2013-01-27 12:34  xavier

	* [r9893] Removed some PUSH_SUBs from routines that are called too
	  often.

2013-01-27 13:09  xavier

	* [r9894] * Added clamdblas and clamdfft to the list of optional
	  libraries and
	  config options.

2013-01-27 13:13  xavier

	* [r9895] Added a test for the OpenCL Poisson solver.

2013-01-28 15:11  xavier

	* [r9896] * Added the new tests to the makefile.
	  * Changed the title of the specific Hatree tests.

2013-01-28 16:58  xavier

	* [r9897] Bugfix: the size of the Fourier space operator was wrong
	  for OpenCL.

2013-01-28 17:05  dstrubbe

	* [r9898] Removed unnecessary output.

2013-01-28 17:51  dstrubbe

	* [r9899] Comments and more checking.

2013-01-28 18:10  dstrubbe

	* [r9900] Removed unused variables 'gx'.

2013-01-28 21:08  dstrubbe

	* [r9901] * Fixed confusing names of arguments to intcoslog: its gx
	  and gy were named in reverse from other occurrences.
	  * Making sure to use double precision in converting integer to
	  float.
	  * Removed useless variable 'vec'.
	  * Some comments.
	  * Formatting.

2013-01-29 10:59  acastro

	* [r9902] Initialized a variable that sometimes could be used
	  uninitialized.
	  
	  Added gsl_set_error_handler_off in oct_1dminimize routine, since
	  the code
	  should continue even if the minimization is not successful.
	  (Perhaps we should
	  think about a general policy for gsl_set_error_handler_off?)

2013-01-29 16:16  xavier

	* [r9903] The opencl implementation of mesh_to_cube was wrong.

2013-01-29 19:43  dstrubbe

	* [r9904] Just as the spherical cut-off FFT kernel takes the
	  maximum box size for a finite direction as the one to use in all
	  directions, the cylindrical cut-off FFT kernel should take the
	  maximum box size for the two finite directions to use in both of
	  those. This was not happening and could easily give spurious
	  interactions.

2013-01-29 21:06  dstrubbe

	* [r9905] * The unocc mode now obeys 'OutputEvery' so you can get
	  restart data written for calculations that get killed by a
	  scheduler.
	  * Clarified and updated documentation on OutputEvery, which was
	  quite misleading. Note: the Sternheimer modes write restart data
	  on every iteration always.

2013-01-30 02:01  dstrubbe

	* [r9906] Option for testing to show convergence of occupied states
	  too in unocc mode.

2013-01-30 02:28  dstrubbe

	* [r9907] Clarifications to documentation about mesh partitioners.

2013-01-30 03:51  dstrubbe

	* [r9908] Some comments regarding mesh partitioning.

2013-01-30 11:02  xavier

	* [r9909] Missing condition for an if.

2013-01-30 19:13  dstrubbe

	* [r9910] Fixing race condition in clean_stop: proc 0 might find
	  the file 'stop' present, delete it, and then exit the loop, but
	  other processors arriving in the routine later would not see the
	  file there anymore, and not exit the loop, so the code would hang
	  rather than exit cleanly.

2013-01-30 19:42  dstrubbe

	* [r9911] * Fixed intent.
	  * Indentation.

2013-01-30 22:43  dstrubbe

	* [r9912] Missing deallocation.

2013-01-31 05:20  dstrubbe

	* [r9913] Formatting, indentation, push/pop.

2013-01-31 18:07  dstrubbe

	* [r9914] * Improved usefulness of DebugLevel = 1 output from CG
	  eigensolver by expressing residual in scientific notation.
	  * Added similar output for CG_new and evolution solvers.
	  * Fixed indentation in LOBPCG.

2013-01-31 23:03  dstrubbe

	* [r9915] On chum intel mpich2, my recent change to clean_stop
	  involving MPI_Bcast (r9910) caused the CAETRS test to hang
	  because it uses 'task parallelization' with slave nodes for the
	  Poisson equation. The slaves do not enter the "calculation mode"
	  routine and thus do not call clean_stop. That routine, therefore,
	  should broadcast only over the communicator for the masters, not
	  MPI world. To do so, we must now pass the multicomm object in
	  some more places.

2013-02-01 16:52  dstrubbe

	* [r9916] Initialization to zero of the eigensolver errors for each
	  state. Otherwise, if you do rmmdiis without subspace
	  diagonalization (or with independent particles), since the
	  routine for the initial minimization steps does not calculate
	  residuals, you will may get scary NaN or 10^200 or something in
	  the Error column since it was uninitialized. Now you will have
	  zero there instead, which still looks odd but doesn't imply that
	  the calculation has gone crazy.

2013-02-01 17:41  dstrubbe

	* [r9917] Reducing error verbosity a little.

2013-02-01 17:42  dstrubbe

	* [r9918] Increasing the label length for profiling tags since some
	  were being cut off.

2013-02-01 18:03  dstrubbe

	* [r9919] Typo in variable documentation.

2013-02-01 20:18  dstrubbe

	* [r9920] Revision to documentation on ParallelizationGroupRanks,
	  which seemed to suggest there was no way of specifying
	  domain/other parallelization.

2013-02-01 21:50  dstrubbe

	* [r9921] Removed conflicting duplicated input tag.

2013-02-01 22:46  dstrubbe

	* [r9922] Adding an option to require convergence of the individual
	  eigenvectors.

2013-02-01 23:49  dstrubbe

	* [r9923] Two more errors should be only_root_writes in casida.

2013-02-02 05:29  dstrubbe

	* [r9924] Inserting a note when a test run wants more than 4 MPI
	  tasks. This can be done (in moderation) to increase the
	  likelihood of finding race conditions, says Xavier.

2013-02-02 19:23  dstrubbe

	* [r9925] Comment about running with more than 4 MPI tasks in the
	  testsuite.

2013-02-04 09:43  marques

	* [r9926] Added the functionals MGGA_X_MN12_L and MGGA_X_MN12_SX

2013-02-04 11:10  marques

	* [r9927] Made PW91 code a bit more general.
	  Reset of the testsuite

2013-02-04 12:16  marques

	* [r9928] Added more flexibility to Becke95

2013-02-04 12:34  marques

	* [r9929] Added mgga_xc_pwb6k and mgga_xc_pw6b95

2013-02-04 13:17  marques

	* [r9930] Added mgga_xc_tpsslyp1w

2013-02-04 13:47  marques

	* [r9931] Added hyb_gga_xc_mpwlyp1m

2013-02-05 09:31  marques

	* [r9932] Added the functionals GGA_X_N12 and GGA_X_N12_SX. Note
	  that the library "Minnesota Functional Module" seems to have a
	  bug: F1 is initialized, so Pi=acos(-F1) gets the value of Pi/2
	  ;(((

2013-02-05 11:46  marques

	* [r9933] Added GGA_C_N12 and GGA_C_N12_SX.
	  Corrected the spelling of Minnesota.

2013-02-05 13:34  marques

	* [r9934] Added functionals MGGA_C_M08_HX, MGGA_C_M08_SO,

	  Pure 'other' parallelization is a bad default. Trying to solve
	  Poisson separately on each node consumes excessive memory and
	  time. In principle, we would have joint domain/other
	  parallelization, but 'other' parallelization takes precedence,
	  especially since multicomm_init does not know the actual problem
	  size and uses a fictitious value of 10000, making it impossible
	  to choose joint parallelization wisely, and generally resulting
	  in a choice of only one domain group. This should be fixed later.
	  
	  * For now, I have made domain parallelization the default for
	  Casida.
	  * Clarified that the parallelization is not in e-h pairs really,
	  but their matrix elements (i.e. between two e-h pairs).
	  * Using hybrid domain/other parallelization for the Casida test.

	  max(lcao_start, st%st_start). This led to the states not being

	  from the atomic orbitals. Also, only processors in states-group 0
	  had the full list of eigenvalues, even though they are supposed
	  to be global; this probably was not a problem though. I have
	  converted use of st%X(psi) to states_set_state in the
	  initialization to zero, and also removed the distinction between
	  initialization when lcao_start == 1 and when it is not. Finally,
	  I had to rename the integer 'max' which interfered with the
