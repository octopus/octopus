!%Description
!% Defines the exchange and correlation functionals to be used,
!% specified as a sum of an exchange functional and a
!% correlation functional, or a single exchange-correlation functional
!% (<i>e.g.</i> <tt>hyb_gga_xc_pbeh</tt>). For more information on the functionals, see
!% <a href=https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc/wikis/Functionals-list-4.0.4>
!% Libxc documentation</a>. The list provided here is from libxc 4; if you have
!% linked against a different libxc version, you may have a somewhat different set
!% of available functionals. Note that kinetic-energy functionals are not supported.
!%
!% The default functional will be selected by Octopus to be consistent
!% with the pseudopotentials you are using. If you are not using
!% pseudopotentials, Octopus cannot determine the functional used to
!% generate the pseudopotential, or the pseudopotential functionals
!% are inconsistent, Octopus will use the following defaults:
!%
!% <br>1D: <tt>lda_x_1d + lda_c_1d_csc</tt>
!% <br>2D: <tt>lda_x_2d + lda_c_2d_amgb</tt>
!% <br>3D: <tt>lda_x + lda_c_pz_mod</tt>
