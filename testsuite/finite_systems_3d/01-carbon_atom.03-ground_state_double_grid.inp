# The purpose of this test is making sure that spin-polarized
# calculations work.
# It is the calculation of one atom of Carbon, within the LSDA
# calculation.
#
# The result *almost* compares (to within 0.1eV) with the results
# given at the NIST webpage:
# http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/DFTdata/contents.html
# The reasons for the discrepancy may be two:
# o The NIST calculation is all-electron.
# o The NIST calculation uses the VWN correlation. Here I have put
#   put PZ, because otherwise the results are even worse (probably
#   our VWN has some bug?)
# It would be nice to investigate the reason for the small
# discrepancy...
