# This tests the oct-harmonic-spectrum utility. It computes the high harmonic generation
# of a 1D model of Hydrogen, when irradiated with a 800 nm, 10^14 W/cm^2, 8 periods laser
# pulse. By changing a few parameters (see the input files), the computation will be
# equal, except for few numerical differences (proagation scheme, etc), with the 
# calculation presented in S. C. Rae et al., Phys. Rev. A. 50, 1946 (1994). That was one
# of the first HHG spectra computed, shortly after the high harmonics from atomic gases
# were discovered. The results obtained with octopus are similar to the ones shown in 
# Fig. 2(a) of that paper.
