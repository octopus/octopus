Test       : 1D Asymmetric Double Well
Programs   : octopus; octopus_mpi
TestGroups : long-run, oct, optimal_control
Enabled    : Yes

# The test ensures a number features of the optimal control implementation in octopus.
# It replicates some of the results given in:
# J. Werschnik and E. K. U. Gross, J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt 7, S300 (2005).
#
# First, we obtain the two lowest eigenstates of the asymmetric double well:
#
# V(x) = 1/64*(x)^4-1/4*(x)^2+1/256*(x)^3
#
Input: 05-adw.01-ground_state.inp
match ; Total energy ; GREP(ground_state_static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; -0.62061585
match ; 2th state    ; GREP(excited_states_static/eigenvalues, '2   --', 12) ; -0.463839

# Now we run an OCT run identical (or almost, the numerical parameters
# are slightly different) to the one described in section 5.1.1, and
# in Fig. 2. It transfers the particle from the left well to the right
# well, by making use of the WG05 algorithm, and with a fixed fluence.
#
# It runs for only two iterations (which is enough to test that the
# implementation is working), but if it is continued it replicates
# nicely the results given in Fig. 2.
Input: 05-adw.02-filter_fixed.inp
match ; J1 1st iteration  ; GREP(opt-control/convergence, ' 1  ', 40) ; 0.00063351
match ; J1 1st iteration  ; GREP(opt-control/convergence, ' 2  ', 40) ; 0.57998624

# Now use add a filter. This corresponds to the case presented in
# Fig. 5 of the same paper. Once again, we stop at iteration #2; 
# however if the run is continued it reproduces nicely the result 
# given in the paper (not exactly, due probably to small numerical 
# differences).
