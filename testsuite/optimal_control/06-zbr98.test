# This test demonstrates how the code [svn revision #4473] permits to replicate
# the QOCT results presented in [W. Zhu, J. Botina, and H. Rabitz, J. Chem. Phys.
# 108, 1953 (1998)]. This demonstrates the use of the QOCT algorithm presented
# in that paper ("ZBR98").
#
# In particular, it reproduces the first case study (Figs. 1-4). It corresponds
# to the transition for the v=0 to the v=1 vibrational state for an OH bond,
# as modeled by a Morse potential.
#
# First, we have to get the ground state and the first excited state.

# Then, the OCT run. It goes only until the first iteration; in order to obtain
# the convergence history presented in Fig. 1, one should go up to 20 iterations.
# The laser pulse presented in Fig. 2 is obtained after around 60 iterations.
#
# Note that the precise convergence history is rather dependent on the numerical
# details -- for example, it dependes on how much one converges the eigenstates
# in the first, ground-state, calculation. The final result is a bit more robust,
# but still it may happen that a rather different start might lead to a
# different maximum.
#
# The reason for this sensitivity is that the starting field is actually an
# unstable solution of the equations, and therefore the behaviour of the first
# iterations depends on numerical noise.
