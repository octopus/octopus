Test       : 1D Box (NLOPT)
Options    : nlopt
Program    : octopus
TestGroups : long-run, optimal_control
Enabled    : Yes

# The test checks several optimal-control algorithm, all of them based on the NLOPT library.
# It calculates the optimal laser field that transfers the ground state to the first excited state. 
# 
# We do the following intermediate steps:
# First, the two lowest eigenstates of the box
# V(x) = -5*step(x+5)*step(5-x),
# are calculated. 
Input: 04-box.01-ground_state.inp
Input: 04-box.02-unocc.inp
# These are the same files as in the 04-box.test. No need for matches.

# run the optimization with the NLOPT BOBYQA algorithm
Options : nlopt
Input: 13-box.03-bobyqa.inp
