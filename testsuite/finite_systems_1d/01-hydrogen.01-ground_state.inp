# This test calculates a one-dimensional model for Hydrogen, considering
# a soft-Coulomb nuclueus-electron interaction. It calculates the ground-state
# in a first run, and then the first nine excited states in the "unocc" mode.
# It is about the simplest thing one can do with octopus...
#
# It is a replication of the calculation presented in Table I of
# [J. Javanainen, J. H. Eberly and Q. Su, Phys. Rev. A 38, 3430 (1998)].
# The numbers provided in that Table should match the values that octopus
# prints in the excited_states_static/eigenvalues file.
