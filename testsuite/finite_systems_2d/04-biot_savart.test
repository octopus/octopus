# The code calculates the Lz=1 state of one electron sitting in a
# potential circular ring. The result is a uniform electronic ring
# circulating through the ring. The code then calculates the current
# flow for this ring (this is the first number matched below).
#
# Then, the Biot-Savart law is applied to calculate the magnetic field 
# at the center of the ring. If we imagine an infinitely thin loop, the 
# Biot-Savart law predicts a magnetic field of (2*pi*I)/(c*R), where
# I is the current flow, c is the velocity of light, and R is the radius
# of the ring.
#
# The current for the model described in the input file is 0.01787 au,
# and the radius of the ring is 3. Therefore, the predicted magnetic field
# is 0.0002731 au, quite close to the value produced by the test.
