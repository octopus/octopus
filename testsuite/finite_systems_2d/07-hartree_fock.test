Test       : Hartree-Fock
Author     : Alberto
Date       : 26.10.07
Arch       : Linux g38 2.6.21-desktop-2 #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue May 8 11:54:36 CEST 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
Release    : 3.0.1
Programs   : octopus
TestGroups : short-run
Enabled    : Yes

# This tests the Hartree-Fock implementation. It reproduces one number
# given in: [B. Reusch et al., Phys. Rev. B 63, 113313]. I have chose
# a 2D calculation because of the great computational load produced by
# Hartree-Fock calculation.
#
# The input file produces an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for
# a two-electron quantum-dot in an S=1 configuration. The details of
# the calculation correspond to the first row of Table I in the
# aforementioned paper. The units in that table are given in units of
# "omega", and since omega in this case is 0.25 effective atomic
# units, 1.0419 e.a.u. corresponds to 4.168, as given in the table.

Input: 07-hartree_fock.01-2electrons.inp
Match ; Total energy ; sed -n '/^Energy:/{n\;p\;}' static/info ; \s*Total\s*=\s*1.0419

# Results for 8 electrons quantum dots, provided in the paper, can
# also be approximately reproduced. I do not put a test because it
# would be too slow. In fact, the results provided by octopus are
# lower in energy and closer to the Quantum Montecarlo numbers, which
# could be do to the use of an underconverged basis set in the paper.
