# The following tests reproduced some basic results from:
# E. Rasanen et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 235307 (2003).
#
# This calculation adds one electron to the previous test, and performs a spin-polarized calculation.
# This calculations permits to obtain one point in Fig. 3 of [E. Rasanen et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 235307 (2003).]: 
# that point corresponding to the chemical potential for the three electron dot, with beta = 1.
