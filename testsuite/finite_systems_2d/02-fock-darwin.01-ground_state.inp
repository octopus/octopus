# This is a 2D system of 20 non-interacting electrons in 2D, confined
# by a harmonic potential. To this field we add a static magnetic
# field, perpendicular to the plane. The resulting list of eigenvalues
# should be the Fock-Darwin spectrum:
#  E(n, l) = (2*n + 1 + abs(l)) * Omega + 0.5 * l * w_c
# where w_c = (e*B)/(m*c) is the cyclotron frequency (e and m are the
# charge and mass of the electron, respectively, and c is the speed of
# light), and Omega = sqrt(omega^2 + (w_c/2)^2) -- omega is the frequency
# that defines the Harmonic well. n = 0, 1, 2, ...; 
# l = 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ....
