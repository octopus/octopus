# This input files reproduces results from:
# [M. Payami and T. Mahmoodi, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 18, 75 (2006)].
# All numbers from Table I may be obtained by properly choosing
# r_s and N_electrons.
#
# However, they are not reproduced exactly, probably due to differences
# in the numerical representation. This is a bit of a problem, since the
# differences between KLI and full EXX are smaller than this (hopefully
# only) numerical error.
#
# Figure 4 can also be obtained, although for some reason only if 
# the density is divided by 2. I think that in the paper they slipped
# some factor of 2.


# First, we reproduce the LSDA results for Li, 8 electrons.
