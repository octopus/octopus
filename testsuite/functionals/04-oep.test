# This input files reproduces results from:
# [M. Payami and T. Mahmoodi, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 18, 75 (2006)].
# All numbers from Table I may be obtained by properly choosing
# r_s and N_electrons.
#
# However, they are not reproduced exactly, probably due to differences
# in the numerical representation. This is a bit of a problem, since the
# differences between KLI and full EXX are smaller than this (hopefully
# only) numerical error.
#
# Figure 4 can also be obtained, although for some reason only if 
# the density is divided by 2. I think that in the paper they slipped
# some factor of 2.


# First, we reproduce the LSDA results for Li, 8 electrons.
Input: 04-oep.01-jellium-lsda.inp
match ; Total energy ; GREP(static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; -0.50498581
match ; Exchange     ; GREP(static/info, 'Exchange    =', 20) ; -0.95512970
match ; Eigenvalue   ; GREP(static/info, '1   --', 13) ; -0.201113

# Now, EXX/KLI for Li, 8 electrons (restarting from the previous run)
Input: 04-oep.02-jellium-exx_kli.inp
match ; Total energy ; GREP(static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; -0.33269873
match ; Exchange     ; GREP(static/info, 'Exchange    =', 20) ; -1.03286631
match ; Eigenvalue   ; GREP(static/info, '1   --', 13) ; -0.251965


# And finally, full EXX for Li, 8 electrons (restarting from the previous run)
# FULL OEP is disabled for the 3.0 release.
#Input: 04-oep.03-jellium-full_exx.inp
#match ; Total energy ; GREP(static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; XXXX
#match ; Exchange     ; GREP(static/info, 'Exchange    =', 20) ; XXXX
#match ; Eigenvalue   ; GREP(static/info, '1   --', 13) ; XXXX
