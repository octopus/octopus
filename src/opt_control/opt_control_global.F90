    !%Description
    !% Optimal Control Theory can be performed with <tt>Octopus</tt> with a variety of different
    !% algorithms. Not all of them can be used with any choice of target or control function
    !% representation. For example, some algorithms cannot be used if 
    !% <tt>OCTControlRepresentation = control_function_real_time</tt>    
    !% (<tt>OCTScheme</tt> > <tt>oct_straight_iteration</tt>), and others cannot be used 
    !% if <tt>OCTControlRepresentation = control_function_parametrized</tt>
    !% (<tt>OCTScheme</tt>  <  <tt>oct_straight_iteration</tt>).
    !%Option oct_zbr98 1 
    !% Backward-Forward-Backward scheme described in <i>JCP</i> <b>108</b>, 1953 (1998).
    !% Only possible if target operator is a projection operator.
    !% Provides fast, stable and monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_zr98  2
    !% Forward-Backward-Forward scheme described in <i>JCP</i> <b>109</b>, 385 (1998).
    !% Works for projection and more general target operators also. The convergence is 
    !% stable but slower than ZBR98. 
    !% Note that local operators show an extremely slow convergence. It ensures monotonic 
    !% convergence.
    !%Option oct_wg05  3
    !% Forward-Backward scheme described in <i>J. Opt. B.</i> <b>7</b>, 300 (2005).
    !% Works for all kinds of target operators, can be used with all kinds of filters, and 
    !% allows a fixed fluence.
    !% The price is a rather unstable convergence. 
    !% If the restrictions set by the filter and fluence are reasonable, a good overlap can be 
    !% expected within 20 iterations.
    !% No monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_mt03 4
    !% Basically an improved and generalized scheme. 
    !% Comparable to ZBR98/ZR98. See [Y. Maday and G. Turinici, <i>J. Chem. Phys.</i> <b>118</b>, 8191 (2003)].
    !%Option oct_krotov 5
    !% The procedure reported in [D. Tannor, V. Kazakov and V.
    !% Orlov, in <i>Time-Dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics</i>, edited by J. Broeckhove
    !% and L. Lathouweres (Plenum, New York, 1992), pp. 347-360].
    !%Option oct_straight_iteration 6
    !% Straight iteration: one forward and one backward propagation is performed at each
    !% iteration, both with the same control field. An output field is calculated with the
    !% resulting wavefunctions. 
    !%Option oct_cg 7
    !% Conjugate-gradients, as implemented in the GNU GSL library. In particular, the
    !% Fletcher-Reeves version.
    !%Option oct_bfgs 8
    !% The methods use the vector Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm.  
    !% Also, it calls the GNU GSL library version of the algorithm. It is a quasi-Newton 
    !% method which builds up an approximation to the second derivatives of the function using
    !% the difference between successive gradient vectors.  By combining the first and second 
    !% derivatives the algorithm is able to take Newton-type steps towards the function minimum, 
    !% assuming quadratic behavior in that region. We have chosen to implement the "bfgs2" version,
    !% as GSL calls it, which is supposed to be the most efficient version available, and a faithful 
    !% implementation of the line minimization scheme described in "Practical Methods of Optimization",
    !% (Fletcher), Algorithms 2.6.2 and 2.6.4.  
    !%Option oct_direct 9
    !% This is a "direct" optimization scheme. This means that we do not make use of the
    !% "usual" QOCT equations (backward-forward propagations, etc), but we use some gradient-free
    !% maximization algorithm for the function that we want to optimize. In this case, the
    !% maximization algorithm is the Nelder-Mead algorithm as implemeted in the GSL. The function
    !% values are obtained by successive forward propagations.
    !%Option oct_nlopt_bobyqa 11
    !% The BOBYQA algorithm, as implemented in the NLOPT library -- therefore, octopus has to
    !% be compiled with it in order to be able to use this option.
    !%Option oct_nlopt_lbfgs 12
    !% The local BFGS, as implemented in the NLOPT library -- therefore, octopus has to
    !% be compiled with it in order to be able to use this option.
